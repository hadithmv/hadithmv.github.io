# changed format of this .yml file to .txt, to disable it
# not gonna use this, cuz
# i've chosen to use mirror-action ci over gitlab-mirror-and-ci-action, because this ssh key does not expire, while the person token used in the other one does

        # Be sure to define the GITLAB_PASSWORD secret in https://github.com/<namespace>/<repository>/settings/secrets
        # Before setup a token to use as GITLAB_PASSWORD here https://gitlab.com/profile/personal_access_tokens
        # The token must have read_api, read_repository & write_repository permissions in GitLab.
        # For granular permissions create seperate users and tokens in GitLab with restricted access.
