## 📖 About Hadithmv

### The Dhivehi Platform for the Sunnah

The Hadithmv project is a comprehensive, collaborative initiative dedicated to translating and disseminating the teachings of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ and the righteous Salaf in the Dhivehi language. We aim to make authentic Islamic knowledge accessible to all Maldivians and empower them to connect with traditional scholarship in their native tongue. Our mission bridges classical Islamic texts with modern technology to serve the unique needs of the Dhivehi-speaking community.

## 🔭 Our Vision

To create the most comprehensive, accurate, and accessible digital collection of Islamic texts in Dhivehi, empowering every Maldivian to connect with the Sunnah and the way of the Salaf regardless of their background, location, or resources.

## 🧩 Our Approach

We embrace modern technology as a powerful tool given by Allah to facilitate Da’wah and spreading beneficial knowledge. We harness these tools to:

- Create a feature-rich, intuitive experience for users of all ages and backgrounds
- Ensure compatibility across various devices and system configurations
- Maintain consistent accessibility on multiple platforms: Web, Android, and Windows
