Help Spread the Sunnah - Your Support Makes a Difference
The Hadithmv Project is a unique initiative dedicated to making the authentic teachings of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ and his righteous followers freely accessible to the Maldivian community in their native language, Dhivehi. By providing free, high-quality translations of Hadith, Quran, and Islamic texts, we aim to empower individuals with knowledge and strengthen their connection to the Sunnah. Your support can help us continue this vital work and expand our project to benefit people even more. By donating, you become part of this effort to preserve and share knowledge.

Why Support Hadithmv?
Accessibility for All: Hadithmv is committed to breaking barriers of language, wealth, and location. Your donation ensures that every Maldivian, regardless of their circumstances, can access authentic Islamic knowledge for free.
Sadaqah Jariyah: By supporting Hadithmv, you contribute to a continuous act of charity. Every person who benefits from the resources we provide becomes a source of ongoing reward for you.
Empowering the Ummah: Many of the challenges faced by our society stem from a lack of understanding of the Sunnah. Your donation helps us educate and inspire individuals, families, and communities to live by the teachings of Islam.
Preserving Knowledge: Hadithmv is building a comprehensive database of Dhivehi translations of Hadith, Quran, and Islamic texts. Your contribution helps us preserve and share this knowledge for generations to come.

now what i want to do is, make it more about pay what you want or pay what you wish, than it is about asking for donations, as asking for charity can be questionable.

...

dpsk:

Certainly! Shifting the focus from "asking for donations" to a "pay what you wish" model can make the appeal feel more inclusive, empowering, and less transactional. It emphasizes the value of the project while giving supporters the freedom to contribute in a way that feels meaningful to them. Here's a revised version of your text with this approach:
