islamic ministry points to discuss with the minister

----------------------

=== SUGGESTIONS FOR MINISTRY ===

* REDUCE MISTAKES IN PAPERWORK

- me and my friends have noticed many a time,
when getting things like dharus hudda, foiy faas, and other documents from ministry,
they get sent to us with errors, typos and mistakes
like wrong spelling or names or ID numbers
and these need to be brought back to the ministry for corrections
sometimes when we have returned to saudi or islands
so it would be good to make the system more error free,
note down the instances where these happen
in this department, this section, this employee brought this document, signed by this massooluveriyaa, with mistakes, on this date
it was corrected and sent back on this date
look for where and when these things happen, reduces chances for errors, improve accuracy
otherwise things stay as is

* NAME APPROVAL

- name approval system needs to be improved
currently it is done by two parties, islamic ministry and male city council
there are various lists of names in several places
islamic ministry has 4 lists, firihen nanthah, anhen nanthah, fahun faaskuri firihen, fahun faaskuri anhen
dating to 2014, outdated, needs to be updated
as for male council, has one list, dating to 2022
when looking to give a name for a child, there are a total of 5 different lists around, all outdated
also council approved names are sometimes very bad, not suitable
some names on the ministry list also have mistakes
all that needs to be corrected and updated
maybe bring that under just the ministry as its own mandate
and quicken the approval process

- there should be a modern way to search names on the ministrys website,
maybe even an app
not as a pdf, but as an interactive, searchable database
these letters, male names, female names'
easy to add, easy to update for the ministry, easy to use by the user
and it would be updated with new entries as more names are approved
instead of users being limited to a list of names from 2014
saves ministry from having to repeat approvals, saving time and manpower


* CUSTOMS BOOK CLEARANCE

- right now the system is, that all arabic / islamic books brought in from outside, airport are held by customs:
sent to islamic ministry for checking
sent back to customs once cleared
its importanant, to prevent bad books from entering maldives, but it can be more efficient,
to have a list of already approved books from the ministry,
which customs could check, this title, this author, etc
if its not on the list, it gets sent to ministry, who then checks and updates the list
this way, it saves time and manpower for ministry, customs, individuals, as well as bookshops
students bring a lot of books during the 6-8 years they study
even sheikhs bring books from umrah trips
yet currently customs holds this all


* BOOK AND OTHER FORM SUBMISSION

- two printed copies for submission:
ministry says to bring two copies every time.
yet after the initial submission, there are many corrections and back and forth to do
so no need for the second copy at that point, it is a waste, as well as a lot of print expense
rather initially, one copy should be brought, and only after all the corrections and back and forths are done, when it is ready for approval, should a second copy be brought, one for the writer, one for the ministry

- it takes extremely long for books to be approved:
this needs to be improved
sometimes even very short books, take a very long time to be approved,
many months, a year even
even now we have maybe 4-5 waiting in the ministry, since last year, sometimes when we ask they say, they have not assigned someone or it hasnt started to be checked yet

- submitting original asl book of translation:
arabic books are not available in raajje, they are printed in saudi
when we tell them this, they say to see if we can get an umra group to bring it, many umra groups no?
but not easy, not practical at all
sometimes when we give the hardcopy asl book, ministry loses it
that can happen if everything is done manually with a file and cabinet system
would be easier, if its on shamela, to suffice with that, as all can see it, even if not brought to ministry separately
or even if not in shamela, if theres a pdf, to look at that

- calling for the physical attendance of writers:
when ministry needs to discuss about a submitted book, they say to come there
even when ministry needs to talk to sheikhs about other matters not regarding books
but that is not always practical, we could be in saudi, or in a raajjetherey island, have to take chutti
in this age, we could use messaging, email, audio and video calls instead

- online submission:
right now, 2 physical copies have to be printed, along with the forms and other papers, for book approval, and brought to the ministry during working hours
instead of that, do it online, digitally
like for example, national bureau of classification, previously known as the censorboard, reviews books and provides approval and isbn numbers
previously, had to print all papers and submit everything manually,
but now, it can all be done online, all forms and books can be sent by email, without ever having to go to the office
it would be good to be submit book approvals, and other forms, to the ministry this way
that can be implemented right now via email
and later can be developed into a portal system
i remember, at the very beginning, ministry would require us to provide a soft digital copy, either word or pdf, in cd rom, when submitting books. soft copy submission isnt new.

- review the books digitally instead of manually and physically:
method before was, many sheikhs would be brought into a meeting room
projector showing the book for review on a screen
and everybody would comment
it would take very long to review even a short part,
and the sheikhs themselves would differ even about the use of dhivehi language
instead, review books digitally,
use softcopies, make notes, comments, annotations on the file, and send it back for correction

- following the progress of book approval:
like other government institutions, like when making ID card, when users submit applications
they can see the date it was submitted
like that let the system show when a book was submitted, which sheikh was assigned to it, on which date
if the sheikh changes to another, that too
at this date, the book was given back to the writer for corrections
this date the writer resent them
this date it was finally approved
this way there will be a good order maintained, we will identify which books have been stuck unassigned, or forgotten
sometimes we have to call someone in the ministry many times to see whats the hold up, and to speed things up
right now i think its all recorded manually in log books

- making an index fihuristh of approved books:
ministry has approved many books
it would be easy of them to show that as an informative list on their website, or an app
this title books, was written by this author, in this year
good for research and educative purposes
or if users want to see if a book has already been written previously


* PROVIDE MORE WRITING OPPORTUNIES FOR WRITERS

- when we signed up for ilmuverin pool, we noted that we wanted to participate in writing and research work
but ministry has not reached out to request that we do any such work
not to write books, do translation work, write articles, magazines etc.
they have only reached out to us regarding dhuroos, nothing else
there are a lot of sheikhs, some will be focus on khitabah and speeches,
yet others will focus on kitabah and ilmee works
to mix up these qisms, and give work specialized by these to those, and vice versa, results in a mismatch of skills
pool utilize kuraa goiy ehaa efficient eh nuun egothah, baivaru bottlenecks aa lasthah aadhey mihen hedheema
mihaaruves there could be sheikhs who are better off at giving dhuroos, kept at writing or proofreading
while others who actually want to do writing work, are only given dhars opportunities
we really want to join the ministry in ilmee writing works, we request that the ministry reach out to us for this task specifically, and provide more opportunities in this category of dawah

as for the opportunities that passed,

- before there was a seminar here in islamic ministry,
where palestinian sheikhs were raising awareness about their situation
in that meeting, they read to us a book, arbaoon filistiniyya, and gave us the ijazas
(this is a different book from the arbaeen filistiniyya translated by ansarmen on ilmuveringe gulhun, eki meehunnah tharujama kuran bahaigen)
ministry said at the time it would be translated to dhivehi and distributed
we havent heard of it since, i dont think it materialized
yet after the meeting when it was said it would be translated, and we were having dinner, some of the brothers in the ministry said i would be good translate it, I even said i would do it if they assigned me, but they left it as just suggestion and did not follow up officially. that was an opportunity lost

- later ministry announced some books for translation via bid, which we participated in
but the thing is, there are very few books announced, and bidders can win more than one book
and we noticed that people apply for the bid with their friends and family's names, in order to win even more bids than the maximum allocated to one party
husha alhan annany emme meehaku dhethin bid proposal hifaigen
and also the way the marks scheme is designed, there is no opportunity for younger writers or recent graduates to compete
because older sheikhs with decades of book writing blow everyone out of the water,
so others have no chance, because there is no ceiling to the experience
older sheikhs get like 200-300 marks
while younger applicants get like 0 or 10

- the second time when quran aa behey marukaz also announced a bid, the same thing happened
no chance for younger graduates

- the third time ministry announced a bid, they made it so only those who had already written the book, or were currently writing it, could participated
so again no chance

- so things like; experience point without a maximum limit, multiple book awarded to one party, one party coming to the table with the bids of multiple parties to win more books,
all of these things leave no chance for younger writers or individual applicants

- also note that there were mistakes happening when the ministry was writing down bid details on their paper by the staff. same with quran aa behey marukaz. liyefa nubaiveema kandaafa. also quran aa behey marukaz ga, bid details note koffa photocopy dhin iru, eyga nuves neiy kon foiyfothakah kameh applicants kurimathi lee. then when i pointed this out, because they had already wrote it wrong and gave photocopies, instead of correcting it, they just said, bid natheejaa iulaan kureema eyga onnaaney konkon foiythakakah kan applicants kurimathi lee, faseyhakollan. so i said ok and waited. then when the time came they just sent me an email saying i didnt win the bid. i asked for details, mentioned that islamic ministry previously provided marksheets, and quran behey marukaz staff even said you would provide details of who applied for what books, yet i never recieved and answer.


* IMPROVE THE ISLAMIC ONLINE LIBRARY

- instead of just pdfs, provide interactive, searchable, copyable ebooks
like shamela

- include IUM collection books like that recent arabic dhivehi radheef

* QURAN BROWSER

- right now a lot of writing work involves using the quran tharjama
it would be good if ministry had a quran browser on the website, or as an app, that people could use

* HADITH BROWSER

- similar to above, would show most important collections

- these are shamela like software developments I am talking about.
it would be good to have them in the ministry
with a capable, dedicated IT, software and application section with developers and programmers as well as sheikhs, for this. saudi, jamia and nabawi also has departments like this.
ministry has created a good studio for videography and shooting, it should also have a good IT department for applications and programs.
even aside from onegov, other government institutions and corporations have dedicated teams for this, upgrading the system and ensuring smooth workflow, moving away from paper and going digital,
president muizz also plans to develop maldives digitally,
ministry should also develop these things on their end, taking initiative, acquiring dedicated teams, and IT workforces.

* FOSTERING CONNECTION WITH STUDENTS STILL STUDYING

- work opportunites with students, who are studying for 6-8 years,
they are here in maldives every year on chutti, which can last many months
it would be good for ministry to provide work / dawah opportunities for them during that time
and maybe also provide them with things they can do abroad, like writing work or things like that
this way a connection is fostered even during study, which will only grow stronger by the time they graduate

- a telegram group was created by the ministry, during the last administration
to include the students studying in saudi
to talk to them, listen to their issues, dicuss opportunities, and get feedback from them
yet none of that materialized, students were talking about the problems they were facing, and asking the ministry for solutions, yet there were very few answers to queries, leaving them frustrated,
otherwise, the group was very inactive from the ministrys side, it just existed as is.


=== NEW IDEAS FOR MINISTRY ===

- provide counseling, talks to youth, naseeha by sheikhs
there are a lot of young people, who have doubts, issues, need someone to talk to
when they talk to psychiatrists, they are recommended to consult with sheikhs
sometimes concerned parents call me and some of my friends, wanting us to talk with their children
also jamiyyaa jamaaiy collaborate with places like drug rehabilitation and talk to some youth
bring that as a mandate of islamic ministry
instead of just waiting for people to call the ministry hotline and ask for opinions or fatwas
take initiative to provide sheikhs to engage and do counseling with the community

- have mutoon halaqas, with ijazas in mosques or institutes
foster the learning of the classical texts and basic for students in maldives
can also translate them to dhivehi,
might even collaborate with abdul muhsin al qasim's team in madina to implement this very well in maldives

- make islamic masters / phd treatises done maldivians, especially arabic ones, viewable by students and researchers if not public, for studies and dissertations. this has nothing to do with what kursee is doing on social media these days.

- correct errors in maumoon era quran translation, like yadqudrah.
this is actually more important than most dawee efforts, yet it has been neglected for so long
we hear adaalath and jamiyyathu salaf is writing their own translation, usually because ministry doesnt do anything about it
but this should be a mandate of islamic ministry


=== HADITHMV ===

- taqreed, introduction to books
bulughul maran ge volume, qudsi hadith, dheenee ijtimai haqquthah by uthaymeen, also many many books on hadithmv

- provide dictionaries soft word copies to incorporate to hadithmv, like sheikh fahmi didi's basfoiy, and IUM's arabic dhivehi dictionary

Hadithmv has over 12,000 downloads on the Play Store with a 4.8 star rating, get around 4000 monthly visits to the website, and delivers essential Islamic resources to the Maldivian community, such as:

✅ 11 Books of Hadith and Athar translated into Dhivehi (around 14,000 entries)
✅ 6 Quran Translations and Tafsirs, to help readers understand the Quran in their native language.
✅ 14 Books on Aqida and Usooluddeen, to strengthen faith and understanding of Islamic principles.
✅ 6 Dictionaries to aid learning and research (around 150,000 entries)
✅ Free access across Web, Android, and Windows platforms.

We as students and recently graduated have spent a lot of time and effort as well as money on developing Hadithmv as well as tools, software, licenses and maintenance, and we would like ilmee, fannee and maalee assistance from ministry in this unique project

people at ministry also use hadithmv for things like searching hadith, copying quran ayat and translations, checking previously approved names etc

we would also like to collaborate with the ministry, in translating and providing like hadith and otherwise, as well as providing Khidmah for the sunnah, turath, athar, hadith, and ilmee works

I am sure together we can bring great development and do many beneficial things
