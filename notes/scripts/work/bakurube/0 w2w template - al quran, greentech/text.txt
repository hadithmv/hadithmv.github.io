which is was file given by greentech al Quran

(previously used an older version, its english w2w was buggy, and arabic had an extra row, caused by:
إِلْ يَاسِينَ
being seperated into
إِلْ
يَاسِينَ
)

word_id	sura	ayah	word	Shortcode	words_ar	gtaf_wbw_en

only need the last two, delete all other columns and bottom blank rows
