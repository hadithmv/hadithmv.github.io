make sure not to copy \r into the grep, it will mess things up!!

(\d)(\d)(\d)(\d)
$4$3$2$1

(\d)(\d)(\d)
$3$2$1
[search story, find format: 'character dir: rtl', change 'character dir: default']

(\d)(\d)
$2$1
...

(\d)
$1

then select all, and change char dir to default, so any new numbers you write will be correct too
