WHITE SPACE GETTING REMOVED DUE TO FORCED LINE BREAKS
MAKE A COPY OF THE INDD FILE BEFORE DOING THIS AS THOSE LINE BREAKS ARE NEEDED FOR PRINT

One issue is that when we clean up the <span> tags, some white space is getting removed.
[ayah 24 of book 5]
...I think we can pre process the document from InDesign side or using regex after HTML output.

SOLUTION:
that happens due to forced line breaks in the text.
to fix, before exporting as html,
grep replace all:
\n
with
nothing

save as a copy, dont overwrite original

...

EXPORTING TO HTML BEFORE Processing

File > Export > HTML
Advanced > Dont include classes in HTML
dont need the web resource folder, can delete that

...

OPEN HTML IN VS CODE

Remove all the <span> tags in CODE EDITOR
DO THIS ONLY ONCE! NOT MORE THAN ONCE! as the other times it highlights are needed for footnote numbers

<span.*?>(.+?)</span>
Replace with
$1

do that in vs code, save file without formatting

This should simplify the markup.

...

RUNNING SCRIPT

running the script will output to terminal stats like these below,
check on excel and see whether all numbers are sequential, to ensure everything is as it should be:

Found Aayah: 92
Found Aayah: 93
...
Found Aayah: 195
Found Aayah: 197
Found Aayah: 1
Found Aayah: 2
...
Found Aayah: 22
Found Aayah: 23

...

convert json to google sheets

...

REMOVING DUPLICATE FOONOTES
remember there will be unwanted repeats of footnotes in the last row, of both the tafseer column as well as the footnotes column. remove them manually

...

REMOVING CONCLUSION
dont need the conclusion word at the end of every juz, remove that too, the part with wasallaa...

...

OTHER CHECKS

there still might be missing white space in some places

there might still be places where madina mushaf ayat was used instead of regular unicode, those will look like this: ()

wrap cells in google sheets and see if any madina mushaf characters still got into the processed text, add them to removal list if any

also see if any stray custom font symbols are still showing in the processed text, add them to the replacement map if any

past from temp google sheet to main quran sheet WITHOUT FORMATTING

PROMPT USED TO MOD:

cur:

this script, takes data from an html file like this:

note how it has
sequential footnote numbers both in the body as well as the footnotes

the script processes that html file and gives me json output like this:

note how the footnote numbers are not sequential (both in the tafseer column as well as the footnotes column), and the footnote numbers reset for every row

what id like to change in the output json is,
id like the footnote numbers to be sequential, as they are in the html file

id also like there to be a new line before the footnote number  (both in the tafseer column as well as the footnotes column)

i also dont need the ^ in the footnote numbers either

also, in the json, the footnote data looks like this:

instead, id like it to not be an object, and instead be like
footnote number followed by footnote text, then a new line followed by the next footnote number followed by the next footnote text, as one cell (multiline)

...

I understand you want to make several changes to the footnote handling in the script:
Make footnote numbers sequential across all entries (like in the HTML) instead of resetting for each row
Add newlines before footnote numbers in both tafseer text and footnotes
Remove the ^ from footnote numbers
Change the footnote format in JSON from an array of objects to a single multiline string
Let me analyze the code and make these changes. The key parts we need to modify are in the store_previous_aayah function where the footnote processing happens.
I'll explain what I'm going to do:
First, I'll modify the code to maintain a global counter for footnotes
Change how footnotes are formatted in the tafseer text
Change how footnotes are stored in the JSON output
Let me make these changes:

I've made several key changes to the script:
Added global variables to maintain sequential footnote numbering:
global_footnote_counter to keep track of the next footnote number
footnote_id_to_seq_map to map original footnote IDs to their sequential numbers
Modified find_and_replace_footnote_tags_by_id to:
Assign sequential numbers to footnotes as they're encountered
Use the new format \n[number] for footnote markers (removing the ^ and adding newlines)
Completely rewrote the footnote handling in store_previous_aayah to:
Use the global sequential numbering instead of resetting for each ayah
Store footnotes as a single multiline string instead of an array of objects
Format footnotes as "number text" with newlines between entries
Updated the markdown output to use the new footnote format
The changes should result in:
Sequential footnote numbers that continue across all entries
Newlines before footnote numbers
No ^ in footnote numbers
Footnotes stored as a single multiline string in the JSON

...

now for footnote column all i see is things like

"footnotes": "3 Footnote text for ID 241 not found\n4 Footnote text for ID 240 not found"

"footnotes": "5 Footnote text for ID 239 not found"

"footnotes": "6 Footnote text for ID 238 not found\n7 Footnote text for ID 237 not found"

etc

...

Let me check the HTML file to see how the footnotes are actually structured and why we're not capturing them properly.
Let me check more of the file to find the footnote sections:
Let me search for footnote sections in the file:
Let me search for the actual footnote content in the HTML:
Let me check one of the footnote sections to see its structure:
I see the issue now. The footnotes are in <div> elements with IDs like footnote-243, but they're not inside <section> tags as we expected. Let me modify the script to handle this structure:

I've updated the script to look for footnotes in <div> elements with IDs starting with "footnote-" instead of looking in <section> tags. The script will now:
Find all <div> elements with IDs like "footnote-243"
Extract the footnote number from the ID
Get the footnote text from all <p> tags within the div, or directly from the div if no <p> tags are found
Clean up the text by removing any footnote numbers at the start
Store the footnote text in the footnotes_map
This should now correctly capture all the footnotes from the HTML file. Let's run the script to verify the changes:
Great! The script now found 244 unique footnotes, which is a significant improvement. Let's check the output JSON to verify that the footnotes are being captured correctly:

...

the script now processes the footnotes correctly, but footnote numbers in the footnote column are not in square brackets, i want them to be in square brackets []

currently they are like:

 "footnotes": "3 الْمُخْتَصَرُ فِي التَّـفْسِير مِنْ مَرْكَزِ تَـفْسِيرٍ لِلدِّرَاسَاتِ الْقُرْآنِيَّة بِـالْمَمْلَكَةِ الْعَرَبِيَّةِ السُّعُودِيَّة\n4 صَحِيحُ الْإِمَامِ مُسْلِمٍ"

 "footnotes": "5 التَّـفْسِيرُ الْمُيَسَّرُ مِنْ مَطْبُوعَاتِ وُزَارَةِ الشُّئُونِ الْإسْلاَمِيَّةِ بِـالْمَمْلَكَةِ الْعَرَبِيَّةِ السُّعُودِيَّة"

 ...

I understand now - you want the footnote numbers in the footnotes text to be in square brackets, like [3], [4], [5] etc. I'll modify the script to add square brackets around the footnote numbers in the footnotes text.
I've modified the script to add square brackets around the footnote numbers in the footnotes text. Now when you run the script, the footnotes will be formatted like this:
Apply to text.txt
You can now run the script again to generate the updated output with square brackets around the footnote numbers.

...

instead of 

it should process whatever html file(s) is in the current directory, and name the outputs (json, md) according to the initial name of the html file(s) that was processed

...

I'll modify the script to automatically process all HTML files in the current directory and generate corresponding output files with matching names. I'll update the configuration section to handle this:

I've modified the script to:
Use glob.glob('*.html') to find all HTML files in the current directory
Create a process_html_file() function that handles processing a single HTML file
Generate output filenames based on the input HTML filename:
For example, if input is Book 5.html, outputs will be:
Book 5_output.json
Book 5_output.md
Reset the footnote counters for each file to ensure independent numbering
Process all HTML files found in the directory sequentially
Add better error handling and reporting
Now when you run the script, it will:
Find all HTML files in the current directory
List the files it found
Process each file one by one
Generate corresponding JSON and MD files with names based on the input HTML filename
For example, if you have:
Book 5.html
Book 6.html
It will generate:
Book 5_output.json and Book 5_output.md
Book 6_output.json and Book 6_output.md
You can now run the script and it will automatically process all HTML files in the current directory.

...

i get this error

...

Ah, I see the issue. The variables current_surah_number, current_surah_name, current_aayah_number, and current_tafseer_lines were previously global variables, but they need to be moved inside the process_html_file function since we're now processing multiple files. Let me fix that:
Now the script should work correctly. The changes ensure that:
Each HTML file is processed independently with its own set of variables
The surah mapping is available globally
The footnote counters are reset for each file
The output files are named based on the input HTML filename
You can now run the script again and it should process all HTML files in the directory without the previous error.

...

cant we just not use a surah name normalization at all

i am still getting this error

...

    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
NameError: name 'normalize_str' is not defined

...

Yes, we can simplify this by just using the surah number directly since we're only processing Surah An-Nisa (4). Let me modify the script to remove the normalization and surah name mapping:

I've simplified the script by:
Removing the surah name normalization and mapping completely
Setting the surah number (4) and name ("النِّسَاء") directly in the processing variables
Removing the surah name checking logic since we know we're only processing Surah An-Nisa
Keeping the surah name detection in the text just to know when to start processing, but not using it to determine the surah number
The script should now work without any normalization errors. You can run it again and it will process all HTML files in the directory, treating them as Surah An-Nisa (4).

...

good. now what id also like is, 
to remove all the <span> tags from the html file before doing the rest of the processing on it
perhaps something like
<span.*?>(.+?)</span>
Replace with
$1
should work, or something similar if you have a better way

this is done in order to simplify the markup of the html prior to doing the rest of the processing

...

id like to use this script without this part

current_surah_number = 4  # We know this is Surah An-Nisa
    current_surah_name = "النِّسَاء"

i just dont want surah number or surah name column at actually

...

Ah, I understand now. You want to completely remove the Surah information from the output. I'll modify the script to remove those fields from the data structure and output:

I've made the following changes:
Removed all surah-related variables and fields:
Removed current_surah_number and current_surah_name
Removed surah detection code
Removed surah fields from the JSON output
Removed surah headers from the Markdown output
Simplified the data structure to only include:
aayah_number
tafseer
footnotes
Updated the output formats:
JSON now only contains aayah number, tafseer text, and footnotes
Markdown now starts directly with aayah sections, without surah headers
Updated the processing messages to be more generic
The script will now process the content without any surah information, focusing only on the aayah numbers, tafseer text, and footnotes.

...

copilot:

tried running on book 4 in addition to 5:

why isnt it working for book 4?

...

Let me help investigate why Book 4 is not being processed properly. Let's first check if there's any structural difference between Book 4.html and Book 5.html that might be causing this issue. Let me add some debug prints to help understand where the processing stops.

Let me modify the script to add more debugging information:

Now let's run the script again to see the debug output:

I can see the issue now. Book 4 has 314 paragraphs but no verses are being processed because the script isn't finding a surah header to trigger processing_started = True. Looking at Book 5, we can see it found the surah header "سُوْرَةُ النِّسَاء" which started the processing.

Let me check the content of Book 4.html:

Let me expand our search pattern for the surah header. I'll modify the script to print more debug info about what it finds in Book 4:

Now let's run the script again to see what headers we find in Book 4:

I can see the issue now. The script is actually finding surah headers in Book 4 but it's finding multiple versions of them:

Found سُورَةُ آل عِمْرَان
Found سُورَةُ آل عِمْرَانِ
Found سُورَةُ النِّسَاءِ
This is causing confusion because each time it finds a new surah header, it's resetting the processing state. Let me modify the script to handle this better:

...

cant you make it work no matter the multiple versions of surah headers there could be

...

Yes, I'll modify the script to be more flexible with surah header detection and not reset processing when it finds variant spellings of the same surah. Here's a better approach:

Now let's run the script with these changes to see if it handles Book 4 better:

...

cur:

id like there to be a space after the closing square bracket of a footnote number in the tafseer column

i am still seeing

ހިމެނެއެވެ.[39]ފޮތުގެ
instead of
ހިމެނެއެވެ.[39] ފޮތުގެ

i never asked you to remove newlines

still no space

...

I see the issue. The problem is that the footnote placeholder is being added with a newline (\n) before it, but we need to handle the space after the footnote number differently. Let me modify the code to ensure there's always a space after the footnote number, regardless of whether it's at the start of a line or in the middle of text.

I've made the following changes:
Removed the automatic newline from the placeholder
Added logic to only add a newline if the footnote is at the start of a paragraph
Kept the space after the footnote number
This should now ensure that:
There's always a space after the footnote number
Footnotes in the middle of text (like in your example) will have a space after them without a newline
Footnotes at the start of paragraphs will still have a newline before them
The output should now show ހިމެނެއެވެ.[39] ފޮތުގެ as desired. Would you like to process a file to verify this change works as expected?


I apologize for removing the newlines without your request. You're right - let's keep the newlines as they were before and just ensure there's a space after the footnote number.

I've restored the code to keep the newline (\n) before the footnote number while maintaining the space after it. This should now preserve the original formatting with newlines while ensuring there's a space after the footnote number. Would you like to process a file to verify this works as expected?


I see the issue is still persisting. Let me check the code more carefully. The problem might be that the footnote is being added in a way that doesn't preserve the space. Let me try a different approach by ensuring the space is preserved in the text processing.

I've made two changes:
Changed the footnote placeholder to use a special marker __SPACE__ instead of a regular space
Added code in the clean_text function to replace this marker with an actual space during text processing
This approach should ensure that the space after the footnote number is preserved even after all the text processing. The special marker will be converted to a space at the very end of processing, which should prevent it from being lost or merged with other spaces.

theres another issue,

where mushaf madina custom font characters for the ayat are at the end of the cell text content in the tafsir column

they could come after a new line, or right after the last line of text already there

they look something like these

...

I understand - you want to remove these special Mushaf Madina font characters that appear at the end of the tafseer text. These characters are in the Unicode range U+FC50 to U+FC9F. Let me modify the code to filter these out during text processing.

...

I understand - you want to remove these special Mushaf Madina font characters that appear at the end of the tafseer text. These characters are in the Unicode range U+FC50 to U+FC9F. Let me modify the code to filter these out during text processing.
I've made two changes:
Added a regex pattern in clean_text to remove all Mushaf Madina font characters (Unicode range U+FC50 to U+FC9F)
Also added these characters to the exclusion list in is_quranic_script to ensure they're not treated as Quranic text
This should now:
Remove all those special Mushaf Madina font characters from the tafseer text
Do this regardless of whether they appear at the end of a line or after a newline
Preserve all other text content


I see the issue - these characters are in a different Unicode range than what I initially targeted. Looking at the example, these characters are in the range U+FCA0 to U+FCFF. Let me update the code to include this range as well.

I've updated the code to:
Include both ranges of Mushaf Madina font characters (U+FC50 to U+FC9F and U+FCA0 to U+FCFF) in the removal regex
Update the exclusion list in is_quranic_script to match
This should now remove all those special characters you showed in your example. Would you like to process a file to verify this works as expected?

...
...

this is my code

it processes html files that have a structure, into json and md files

it it supposed to remove mushaf madina font characters from the tafseer column, i think it does that by using a range in a removal regex, and it also has an exclusion list

these are the characters which are still appearing but need to be removed from the tafseer column, note that they can appear on a new line by themselves, or at the end of the last line, they can be few or many, and have spaces

 ﱋﱌﱍ

 ﱎ ﱏ

 ﱁﱂﱃﱄﱅﱆﱇ ﱈ

ﱉﱊﱋﱌﱍﱎﱏ

 ﱋﱌﱍﱎﱏ
 
 
now it is removing these characters correctly:
 ﱎ ﱏ

ﱋﱌﱍﱎﱏ

but these are still showing when they should not be there:
 ﱆﱇﱈﱉﱊ


...

I'll help you modify the code to remove these specific Mushaf Madina font characters. Looking at the code, I can see that the character removal is primarily handled in the clean_text function. Let me analyze and make the necessary changes.
First, let me check the current implementation:
I see that the current code removes Mushaf Madina font characters in the range U+FC50 to U+FCFF in the clean_text function. However, the characters you provided (ﱋ, ﱌ, ﱍ, etc.) are in a different range. Let me modify the code to handle these characters as well.
I'll edit the clean_text function to include these additional characters:

I see that we need to add one more range to handle the characters ﱆ, ﱇ, ﱈ, ﱉ, ﱊ. Let me modify the clean_text function again to include these characters:

I've added another regex pattern to remove characters in the range U+FC46 to U+FC4A, which includes:

...

good. what id also like, is to replace certain text with something else

such as:

 -> سُبحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَى
 -> ﷺ
 -> عَلَيهِ السَّلَامُ
 -> رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُ
 - > رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُمَا
 -> رَحِمَهُمَا اللَّهُ

id also like to switch these two characters with each other:
“ <-> ”


...

I'll modify the clean_text function to include these text replacements. I'll add a dictionary for the text replacements and handle the quote character swapping:

I've made the following changes to the clean_text function:
Added a dictionary text_replacements that maps the special characters to their full text equivalents:
 → سُبحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَى
 → ﷺ
 → عَلَيهِ السَّلَامُ
 → رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُ
 → رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُمَا
 → رَحِمَهُمَا اللَّهُ
Added a quote character swapping mechanism that:
Temporarily replaces " with a placeholder
Replaces " with "
Replaces the placeholder with "
This effectively swaps the two quote characters with each other.
The replacements are done before the Mushaf Madina font character removal, so the full text replacements will be preserved in the final output.

...
