PROMPT USED TO MOD:

cur:

this script, takes data from an html file like this:

note how it has
sequential footnote numbers both in the body as well as the footnotes

the script processes that html file and gives me json output like this:

note how the footnote numbers are not sequential (both in the tafseer column as well as the footnotes column), and the footnote numbers reset for every row

what id like to change in the output json is,
id like the footnote numbers to be sequential, as they are in the html file

id also like there to be a new line before the footnote number  (both in the tafseer column as well as the footnotes column)

i also dont need the ^ in the footnote numbers either

also, in the json, the footnote data looks like this:

instead, id like it to not be an object, and instead be like
footnote number followed by footnote text, then a new line followed by the next footnote number followed by the next footnote text, as one cell (multiline)

...

I understand you want to make several changes to the footnote handling in the script:
Make footnote numbers sequential across all entries (like in the HTML) instead of resetting for each row
Add newlines before footnote numbers in both tafseer text and footnotes
Remove the ^ from footnote numbers
Change the footnote format in JSON from an array of objects to a single multiline string
Let me analyze the code and make these changes. The key parts we need to modify are in the store_previous_aayah function where the footnote processing happens.
I'll explain what I'm going to do:
First, I'll modify the code to maintain a global counter for footnotes
Change how footnotes are formatted in the tafseer text
Change how footnotes are stored in the JSON output
Let me make these changes:

I've made several key changes to the script:
Added global variables to maintain sequential footnote numbering:
global_footnote_counter to keep track of the next footnote number
footnote_id_to_seq_map to map original footnote IDs to their sequential numbers
Modified find_and_replace_footnote_tags_by_id to:
Assign sequential numbers to footnotes as they're encountered
Use the new format \n[number] for footnote markers (removing the ^ and adding newlines)
Completely rewrote the footnote handling in store_previous_aayah to:
Use the global sequential numbering instead of resetting for each ayah
Store footnotes as a single multiline string instead of an array of objects
Format footnotes as "number text" with newlines between entries
Updated the markdown output to use the new footnote format
The changes should result in:
Sequential footnote numbers that continue across all entries
Newlines before footnote numbers
No ^ in footnote numbers
Footnotes stored as a single multiline string in the JSON

...

now for footnote column all i see is things like

"footnotes": "3 Footnote text for ID 241 not found\n4 Footnote text for ID 240 not found"

"footnotes": "5 Footnote text for ID 239 not found"

"footnotes": "6 Footnote text for ID 238 not found\n7 Footnote text for ID 237 not found"

etc

...

Let me check the HTML file to see how the footnotes are actually structured and why we're not capturing them properly.
Let me check more of the file to find the footnote sections:
Let me search for footnote sections in the file:
Let me search for the actual footnote content in the HTML:
Let me check one of the footnote sections to see its structure:
I see the issue now. The footnotes are in <div> elements with IDs like footnote-243, but they're not inside <section> tags as we expected. Let me modify the script to handle this structure:

I've updated the script to look for footnotes in <div> elements with IDs starting with "footnote-" instead of looking in <section> tags. The script will now:
Find all <div> elements with IDs like "footnote-243"
Extract the footnote number from the ID
Get the footnote text from all <p> tags within the div, or directly from the div if no <p> tags are found
Clean up the text by removing any footnote numbers at the start
Store the footnote text in the footnotes_map
This should now correctly capture all the footnotes from the HTML file. Let's run the script to verify the changes:
Great! The script now found 244 unique footnotes, which is a significant improvement. Let's check the output JSON to verify that the footnotes are being captured correctly:

...

the script now processes the footnotes correctly, but footnote numbers in the footnote column are not in square brackets, i want them to be in square brackets []

currently they are like:

 "footnotes": "3 الْمُخْتَصَرُ فِي التَّـفْسِير مِنْ مَرْكَزِ تَـفْسِيرٍ لِلدِّرَاسَاتِ الْقُرْآنِيَّة بِـالْمَمْلَكَةِ الْعَرَبِيَّةِ السُّعُودِيَّة\n4 صَحِيحُ الْإِمَامِ مُسْلِمٍ"

 "footnotes": "5 التَّـفْسِيرُ الْمُيَسَّرُ مِنْ مَطْبُوعَاتِ وُزَارَةِ الشُّئُونِ الْإسْلاَمِيَّةِ بِـالْمَمْلَكَةِ الْعَرَبِيَّةِ السُّعُودِيَّة"

 ...

I understand now - you want the footnote numbers in the footnotes text to be in square brackets, like [3], [4], [5] etc. I'll modify the script to add square brackets around the footnote numbers in the footnotes text.
I've modified the script to add square brackets around the footnote numbers in the footnotes text. Now when you run the script, the footnotes will be formatted like this:
Apply to text.txt
You can now run the script again to generate the updated output with square brackets around the footnote numbers.

...

instead of 

it should process whatever html file(s) is in the current directory, and name the outputs (json, md) according to the initial name of the html file(s) that was processed

...

I'll modify the script to automatically process all HTML files in the current directory and generate corresponding output files with matching names. I'll update the configuration section to handle this:

I've modified the script to:
Use glob.glob('*.html') to find all HTML files in the current directory
Create a process_html_file() function that handles processing a single HTML file
Generate output filenames based on the input HTML filename:
For example, if input is Book 5.html, outputs will be:
Book 5_output.json
Book 5_output.md
Reset the footnote counters for each file to ensure independent numbering
Process all HTML files found in the directory sequentially
Add better error handling and reporting
Now when you run the script, it will:
Find all HTML files in the current directory
List the files it found
Process each file one by one
Generate corresponding JSON and MD files with names based on the input HTML filename
For example, if you have:
Book 5.html
Book 6.html
It will generate:
Book 5_output.json and Book 5_output.md
Book 6_output.json and Book 6_output.md
You can now run the script and it will automatically process all HTML files in the current directory.

...

i get this error

...

Ah, I see the issue. The variables current_surah_number, current_surah_name, current_aayah_number, and current_tafseer_lines were previously global variables, but they need to be moved inside the process_html_file function since we're now processing multiple files. Let me fix that:
Now the script should work correctly. The changes ensure that:
Each HTML file is processed independently with its own set of variables
The surah mapping is available globally
The footnote counters are reset for each file
The output files are named based on the input HTML filename
You can now run the script again and it should process all HTML files in the directory without the previous error.

...

cant we just not use a surah name normalization at all

i am still getting this error

...

    normalize_str("���������"): 4,
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
NameError: name 'normalize_str' is not defined

...

Yes, we can simplify this by just using the surah number directly since we're only processing Surah An-Nisa (4). Let me modify the script to remove the normalization and surah name mapping:

I've simplified the script by:
Removing the surah name normalization and mapping completely
Setting the surah number (4) and name ("النِّسَاء") directly in the processing variables
Removing the surah name checking logic since we know we're only processing Surah An-Nisa
Keeping the surah name detection in the text just to know when to start processing, but not using it to determine the surah number
The script should now work without any normalization errors. You can run it again and it will process all HTML files in the directory, treating them as Surah An-Nisa (4).

...

good. now what id also like is, 
to remove all the <span> tags from the html file before doing the rest of the processing on it
perhaps something like
<span.*?>(.+?)</span>
Replace with
$1
should work, or something similar if you have a better way

this is done in order to simplify the markup of the html prior to doing the rest of the processing

...

I'll add a preprocessing step to remove all <span> tags while preserving their content. We can do this using BeautifulSoup's unwrap() method, which is more reliable than regex for HTML processing. Here's how we'll modify the script:

I've added a preprocessing step that:
Uses BeautifulSoup's find_all('span') to find all <span> tags in the document
Uses the unwrap() method to remove each span tag while preserving its content
Does this before any other processing begins
This approach is better than using regex because:
It properly handles nested tags
It correctly handles spans that contain other HTML elements
It's more reliable for HTML processing than regex
It won't break if there are special characters or formatting in the spans
The script will now:
Load the HTML file
Remove all span tags while keeping their content
Continue with the rest of the processing as before
You can run the script again and it will process the HTML files with the spans removed. This should simplify the markup and make the rest of the processing more straightforward.
