give me all the dhivehi diacritics in a list, just the characters themselves

Here are all the Dhivehi (Thaana script) diacritics:
ަ
ާ
ި
ީ
ު
ޫ
ެ
ޭ
ޮ
ޯ
ް
These diacritics (called fili in Dhivehi) are used to indicate vowel sounds when combined with consonant letters in the Thaana script.

...

what is the javascript regex range for them

The JavaScript regex range for all Dhivehi diacritics is:
[\u0EB0-\u0EBF]

This Unicode range captures all the Thaana diacritics (ަ ާ ި ީ ު ޫ ެ ޭ ޮ ޯ ް).

If you need to use it in a pattern, you could use something like:
const dhivehiDiacriticsPattern = /[\u0EB0-\u0EBF]/g;

This would allow you to test for or match any Dhivehi diacritic character in a string.

...

write me js regex to, find all instances of
ނ
ރ
not being immediately followed by a dhivehi diacritic
but rather rather those two characters have no dhivehi diacritic on them at all

Here's a JavaScript regex to find all instances of ނ or ރ that aren't immediately followed by a Dhivehi diacritic:
([ނރ])(?![ަާިީުޫެޭޮޯް])

/([ނރ])(?![ަާިީުޫެޭޮޯް])/g
This regex uses:

A capturing group ([ނރ]) to match either ނ or ރ
A negative lookahead (?![ަާިީުޫެޭޮޯް]) that asserts the matched character isn't immediately followed by any Dhivehi diacritic

You can use it like this:
const text = "ނަރ ނާރީ ނު ރ ނއ ރް";
const regex = /([ނރ])(?![ަާިީުޫެޭޮޯް])/g;
const matches = [...text.matchAll(regex)];
console.log(matches.map(match => match[0]));
This will find all instances where ނ or ރ appear without being immediately followed by a diacritic.

...

write me js code to
take a text filecalled listRadheefW
catch all the words in there, that have a ނ or ރ  that does not have a diacritic on it
and output the results to a new file called, output_listRadheefW

Here's JavaScript code to process a text file and catch all words containing a ނ or ރ without a diacritic:

// Verify if the encoding is properly set to UTF-8

const fs = require("fs");

// Read the input file
fs.readFile("listRadheefW.txt", "utf8", (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error("Error reading file:", err);
    return;
  }

  // Split the content into words, handling multiple whitespace characters
  const words = data
    .trim()
    .split(/\s+/)
    .filter((word) => word.length > 0);

  // Log some diagnostics
  console.log(`Total words in file: ${words.length}`);

  // Check if any words contain ނ or ރ (just to verify text is being read correctly)
  const anyWithLetters = words.filter(
    (word) => word.includes("ނ") || word.includes("ރ")
  );
  console.log(`Words containing ނ or ރ (anywhere): ${anyWithLetters.length}`);

  // Improved regex to match ނ or ރ not followed by a diacritic
  // Using a lookbehind to check for character boundary or another character before
  const regex = /[ނރ](?![ަާިީުޫެޭޮޯް])/u;

  // Filter words that contain ނ or ރ without a diacritic
  const matchedWords = words.filter((word) => regex.test(word));

  // Log a few matched words for verification
  if (matchedWords.length > 0) {
    console.log("Sample matched words:");
    matchedWords.slice(0, 5).forEach((word) => console.log(`- ${word}`));
  }

  // Write the results to the output file
  fs.writeFile(
    "output_listRadheefW.txt",
    matchedWords.join("\n"),
    "utf8",
    (err) => {
      if (err) {
        console.error("Error writing to output file:", err);
        return;
      }
      console.log(
        `Processing complete. Found ${matchedWords.length} matching words.`
      );
    }
  );
});


This code:

Reads the file 'listRadheefW'
Splits the content into individual words
Uses a regex to identify words containing ނ or ރ without a following diacritic
Writes the matching words to 'output_listRadheefW', one word per line

...

now what i want is, another script
that takes output_listRadheefW.txt
goes thru its list of words, which are words containing ނ or ރ without a following diacritic

what i want is, to remove all characters in that list of words, except that  ނ or ރ without a following diacritic, as well as 2 characters before and 2 characters after the  ނ or ރ without a following diacritic

Here's a script to process the output_listRadheefW.txt file and extract the characters you want:

const fs = require('fs');

// Read the input file
fs.readFile('output_listRadheefW.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Error reading file:', err);
    return;
  }

  // Split the content into words
  const words = data.split(/\s+/);
  
  // Array to store our results
  const results = [];

  // Process each word
  words.forEach(word => {
    // Regex to find ނ or ރ not followed by a diacritic
    const regex = /[ނރ](?![ަާިީުޫެޭޮޯް])/g;
    let match;
    
    // Find all occurrences in the word
    while ((match = regex.exec(word)) !== null) {
      const charIndex = match.index;
      const targetChar = match[0];
      
      // Calculate start and end indices for extraction
      const startIndex = Math.max(0, charIndex - 2);
      const endIndex = Math.min(word.length, charIndex + 2);
      
      // Extract the substring with 2 chars before and 2 chars after
      const extractedText = word.substring(startIndex, endIndex + 1);
      
      results.push(extractedText);
    }
  });

  // Write the results to a new file
  fs.writeFile('extracted_contexts.txt', results.join('\n'), 'utf8', (err) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error('Error writing to output file:', err);
      return;
    }
    console.log(`Processing complete. Extracted ${results.length} context segments.`);
  });
});

This script:

Reads the file 'output_listRadheefW.txt'
For each word, finds all occurrences of ނ or ރ not followed by a diacritic
For each occurrence, extracts the character itself plus 2 characters before and 2 characters after (if they exist)
Writes all extracted segments to a new file called 'extracted_contexts.txt'

...

then what i should do is, remove duplicate rows myself

...

give me regex to match the last character in a word

The regex to match the last character in a word is:
\w$

If you're working with JavaScript:
/\w$/

This will match the last alphanumeric character (letter, digit, or underscore) in a word.
If you need to match any character (not just alphanumeric) that appears at the end of a word or string, you can use:
.$

Or in JavaScript:
/.$/

If you're specifically looking to match the last character in each word of a text (where words are separated by spaces), you would need a slightly different approach using lookbehind and lookahead:
Copy(?<=\b\w*)\w(?=\s|$)

However, not all regex engines support lookbehind. For broader compatibility, you could use:
Copy\b\w\b|\w(?=\s|$)

...

from above, this would do:
.$

replace with nothing

remove duplicates

...

do the same for first character

The regex to match the first character in a word is:
^\w

If you're working with JavaScript:
/^\w/
This will match the first alphanumeric character (letter, digit, or underscore) at the beginning of a string.

If you need to match any character (not just alphanumeric) at the beginning of a string:
^.

Or in JavaScript:
/^./

If you want to match the first character of each word in a text (where words are separated by spaces), you can use:
\b\w

Or in JavaScript:
/\b\w/g

The \b is a word boundary that ensures you're matching the start of a word, and the \w matches the first alphanumeric character of that word. The g flag ensures you find all matches throughout the text.

...

for above, this would do:
^.

remove duplicates

...

regex to find a single character when thats all there is in a line

The regex to find a single character when it's the only thing on a line is:
^.$

In JavaScript:
/^.$/m
This pattern works by:

^ matches the start of a line
. matches any single character
$ matches the end of a line
The m flag (multiline) is important if you're working with multiple lines of text

This will match lines that consist of exactly one character and nothing else (no spaces, no other characters).

If you specifically want to match only lines with a single word character (letter, digit, or underscore):
^\w$

In JavaScript:
/^\w$/m

...

then go over them and prune the list further
