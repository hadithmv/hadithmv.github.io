          number to continue exactly from there, and this method can also be
          used in the app. You can also grab the web URL from within the app

        </h3>
        <p class="en justi inde">
          We are always looking out for people with skills in three key areas:
          Dhivehi, Arabic, and programming. Roles include translating,
          proof-reading and coding. Primarily, applicants should be optimistic,
          self-motivated, responsive, able to meet deadlines, and not feel
          offended when corrected. Obviously, we cannot work with translations
          that are done whenever one feels like doing it. Rather we follow a
          schedule, calculate our releases, and will not put a project on hold
          for anyone or anything. If there is too much delay on any one end,
          work will immediately be transferred to someone else, so as to not
          hold things up. That said, feel free to contact us to know more about
          joining Hadithmv. As for why you should join us; while everyone has
          felt the lack of Dhivehi translations in the public sphere, there
          hasn’t been a good enough effort made for towards that til now.
          Everyone talks about doing it, yet virtually nothing has been done
          about. Then we decided to get things going, and alhamdulillah, we’ve
          grown a lot since we kickstarted this project. And by now, in joining
          Hadithmv, you’d be signing up for a well established project with
          years of experience, plenty of support, that is also open and
          welcoming. Unlike other various groups, we don’t keep ourselves and
          what we do in the dark, nor do we fail to respond when it comes to
          holding up our commitments. People have already seen that we do in
          fact actually get things done, as our work is already out there for
          everyone to access. Furthermore, while some people may have one
          resource or another, like a PDF or a particular book, we have already
          gone beyond that, collecting all that and much more. We also utilize
          specialized tools and modernized resources for the job, which aren’t
          limited to being either just digital or physical, which is the real
          bottleneck that everyone else faces. And this ensures that we are able
          to get our content up and out there as quickly and efficiently as
          possible, and thus the team is able to continuously build upon a
          proven flow of work, instead of having to start out from absolute
          zero.

        </h3>
        <p class="en justi inde">
          One way is by rating the Android app. Note that you can rate without
          showing your name if you don't write anything. Another way is by
          sharing Hadithmv with your friends. If you ever wanted to spread
          Islamic knowledge in Dhivehi, or maybe even thought about distributing
          a lot of books to Maldivians all around the world, then in this day
          and time sharing Hadithmv is as easy as it gets. Furthermore, the
          Prophet ﷺ said: “Whoever guides someone to goodness will have a reward
          like one who did it.” -Sahih Muslim 1893.

        <p class="en justi inde">
          Hadithmv has had various helpers over time. Most of them are friends
          and colleagues from the Islamic University of Madinah, as well as
          brothers and sisters who studied in other colleges and faculties,
          along with other students of knowledge, skilled linguists in the
          Dhivehi and Arabic languages, and others who help with the code
          itself. For a list of contributors please click

          you and me are giving themselves and their free time to contribute in
          so many ways. That said, we will not allow false Aqidas to be hosted
          here on Hadithmv.

        <p class="en justi inde">
          While hadithmv initially started as a website providing the Dhivehi
          translation of Nawawi’s 40 hadith, it has since developed into much
          more. While the primary focus will always be on reviving the Sunnah
          and making it accessible for everyone, it became important to include
          everything that helps in achieving that goal. The most important of
          which would be the Quran, followed by books on the correct Aqida.
          Supporting language material regarding Arabic was also found to be
          indispensable. Other useful tools and content have also made
          available, for those who wish to benefit from them.

        <p class="en justi inde">
          Primarily you can read various Islamic translations of Quran, Hadith,
          Aqidah, Duas as well as other content. You can also use Hadithmv like
          a dictionary. You can find the source references for these books. You
          can lookup texts in Dhivehi as well as Arabic, and can search even
          without Arabic diacritics. You can copy and paste the translations to
          and from any device, through any kind of media. You can select how
          many items to display on the screen at one time. You can jump to any
          page. You can use filter options to see only specific texts. You can
          show and hide different types of text. You can also use keyboard
          shortcuts on the desktop, etc.

          If you are on the app, then simply closing the app fully and then

          items viewed to default, and deselect the extra fields you have chosen
          to show. Or you can just fully clear the cache from the browser and

          Hadithmv is currently funded by the developer and no one else. And all

        <h3 class="en">

        <p class="en justi inde">
          It is the first program of its kind in the Dhivehi language, and as
          far as we are aware, the only. Another game-changer is that here at
          Hadithmv, we fit with the times. We designed our content to load fast,
          and uses a fraction of your data when it does. In more ways than one,
          Hadithmv saves you time and money, because every byte counts.
          Furthermore, we like to keep things minimal yet modern. We don't spend
          our time creating flashy animations or searching for filler
          photographs to go with what to write. We realized early on that a one
          size fits all approach and readily available templates does the job
          much more efficiently. This way we can focus on what is important,
          delivering quality content instead of worrying about trivial secondary
          matters. Nor do we limit ourselves to bulky hard-coded PDFs that are
          hard to read on mobile devices, and even harder to search text in.
          Rather our content is responsive and easily searchable, with custom
          options like copying or choosing how many items to display.
          Furthermore, we don’t do things in waves that come and go, or get
          people worked up on something for short bursts that inevitably fade
          away. Instead, we aim for steady work and sure outcomes that are
          designed to last. And when it comes to social media, we keep things
          bite-sized so subscribers can follow along even on a busy schedule.
          These days, there is a lot less need to ferry people or books back and
          forth across the country, that ship has sailed long ago. And even PDFs
          are fast becoming dinosaurs. The generation of today expects whole
          libraries to fit responsively within their pockets and be able to use
          them easily and immediately within a snap, we hope to continue
          delivering on those expectations, in sha Allah.

        <h3 class="en">
          <a><b>Could you record video and audio to go with the hadith?</b></a>
        </h3>
        <p class="en justi inde">
          Fundamentally, we aim to create content for the source texts, as
          everything is built on that. Once that resource is readily available,
          it becomes easier for everyone else to create multimedia based on it.
          This is why we have chosen to invest most of our time and effort in
          this essential area, as it is more important in the long term than
          spending hours and hours recording or editing other media. As the
          years go by, images will become pixelized and blurry as they keep
          getting reuploaded and compressed over and over again. Videos will
          also become outdated as search algorithms will push them further back
          as new ones come out to replace them. As for audio, one thing is how
          much of a hassle it is to go back and re-record things whenever a
          change in script is called for, and it is almost inevitable that
          Dhivehi text-to-speech engines will develop to a point, where they
          will accurately read whole books for you, instead of you having to
          rely on people to keep recording and editing clips all the time just
          so you can listen in on them. In brief, we concern ourselves with long
          term, long lasting goals instead of temporary short term ones. Because
          the reality is that a lot of channels, groups, domains, events,
          presentations, captions, blogs, posts, articles, web documents etc.
          have all come and gone, leaving not a trace of what once was. But
          without a doubt, there is one thing that remains the same; the
          fundamental value of the core text, which will keep getting reused and
          built upon over and over again, and so that is precisely where we have
          chosen to commit to.

          <a><b>How does Hadithmv make content so quickly?</b></a>
        </h3>
        <p class="en justi inde">
          It is mainly due to our modernized workflow and tools. Instead of
          tediously having to do everything manually, we tend to automate things
          as much as possible. This allows us to create a week’s worth of
          content that otherwise would have taken others months to do by hand.
          We avoid doing things over and over again and suffice with scripts
          wherever possible, as we find manual repetition to be extremely
          cumbersome and a waste of time. Inevitably, modern methods will always
          outstrip legacy ones when it comes to performance and delivery, no
          matter the numbers, even though by the Grace of Allah we have writers
          such that some of them are worth 50 others. Furthermore, we use custom
          software to keep up with our releases, some of which we have mentioned
          or made available for use on the site.

          In sha Allah. We strive to make them as accurate and understandable as
          possible. However, if you do find an inaccuracy somewhere, or even a
          better suggestion, please report it to us so that we may correct it as
          soon as possible. Contact links can be found at the bottom of this
          page. Also note that not everything is to be translated literally, and
          the overall meaning must be preserved when conveying the texts.
          Unfortunately, we see some people trying on their own to piece
          together a translation word-for-word, and then end up failing to
          understand both the text as well as the context. It is important to
          point out that just a dictionary will never, ever be enough to
          translate Islamic books. One must have proper knowledge of Islamic
          sciences such as Nahu, Fiqh, Usool, Mustalah, Ruwat, etc. and even
          then, they must refer to the Explanations of the scholars if they wish
          to translate anything correctly. Otherwise people will just end up
          misleading themselves as well as others.

          They are the sayings, actions, approvals as well as the physical
          characteristics and manners of Muhammad ﷺ, the final Prophet sent by
          Allah. Hadith is also called Sunnah. After the Quran, hadith is the
          second source of all Sharia legislations as well as behavioural
          etiquette standards in Islam. We can only know what we should and
          should not do through the Messenger ﷺ. Following the Messenger ﷺ is
          the only way to salvation and all that is good, and choosing any other
          path is falling into wretchedness and destruction, in this world as

          or an article that can never change. Rather it is possible to edit and
          update the text of Hadithmv anytime. Think of it in terms of a ‘living
          standard’. We are always striving to improve and build upon the
          translations, which are too important to just write once and then
          abandon later on.

          I hold. I follow the Quran and Sunnah upon the understanding of the
          Companions. I affirm the Names and Attributes of Allah as He and His
          Messenger ﷺ did, without changing their wording, interpreting them as
          metaphorical, denying them, likening them to the creation, or asking
          how they are. I hear and obey even if a slave is put over me, and I
          give advice to those in authority privately and not on the streets.
          This is what I was taught at the Islamic University of Madina. And as
          such, we will not allow any other creeds to show up in any of the
          content here. Another important reason why this project had to happen
          was because of the widespread Ash’ari misinterpretations that had
          plagued the existing local translations of Quran and hadith. This had
          gone on for too enough without sufficient people coming forth to
          cleanse them of the various deviations that were inserted. Despite
          Aqida being a major issue, problems such as these still persisted
          throughout generations of Maldivians even with the presence of over
          300 Islamic graduates. But in sha Allah, we aim to solve that issue
          once and for all. May Allah grant us Thaufeeq. Ameen.

          No, that is only something the scholars can do, because the Sharia of
          Allah is not spoken of except with knowledge. While Hadithmv is
          intended to be a resource for various Islamic texts, one or two hadith
          alone is not sufficient for layman to have formed a comprehensive
          opinion on a matter. Many individuals who have not studied even the
          most basic Islamic books or know even the slightest Arabic think that
          just because they have the internet, they are as capable as any
          scholar. This is nothing but a complete and utter fallacy. You cannot
          come up with your own reasoning nor make up your own analogy when it
          comes to Islamic rulings. That is simply not how things work in this
          Deen. Anything related to Fiqh or Fatwa should always be directed to
