Help fund the project</h2><h4>Join us in spreading the sunnah - Your contribution makes a difference</h4><p>The Hadithmv Project is a unique initiative dedicated to making the authentic teachings of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ and his righteous followers freely available in Dhivehi. We believe that knowledge should be accessible to everyone, without barriers. That’s why all our resources —Hadith collections, Quran translations, Tafsir, and Islamic books— are provided for free. By providing high-quality resources and material to everyone, we aim to empower individuals with knowledge and strengthen their connection to the Sunnah.<p>That’s why here at Hadithmv, we’ve adopted a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_what_you_want target=_blank>“Give What You Wish”</a> model. Instead of locking our content and features behind a paywall or asking for donations, we let you decide on how you want to contribute, based on what our services are worth to you. This approach feels more inclusive, empowering, and less transactional, without restricting the benefits for anyone, as we know first-hand the value of shared knowledge. It emphasizes the value of the project while giving our users the freedom to contribute in a way that feels meaningful to them.<h4>Why Contribute?</h4><p>The Hadithmv Project bridges language barriers and brings authentic Islamic knowledge to every Maldivian home. When you support us, you're investing in:<ul><li>Knowledge for Everyone – We keep all content free so that no one is excluded from learning.<li>Educating the Ummah - Helping individuals, families and communities better understand and implement the Sunnah.<li>Sadaqah Jariyah – Every time someone benefits from this platform, your contribution continues to bring you rewards, in sha Allah.<li>Preserving Knowledge - We are building a comprehensive digital library of Islamic texts in Dhivehi. Your support helps us preserve and share this knowledge for generations to come.</ul><h4>The Value We Provide</h4><p>Hadithmv has emerged as a leading digital platform for Islamic material in Dhivehi, delivering over 80 digital publications and attracting around 4000 website visitors a month. It has been downloaded more than 12,000 times, with over 5000 users on mobile, along with a 4.8 star rating. Hadithmv is made up of over 700,000 lines of code, has the <a href=https://github.com/gayanvoice/top-github-users/blob/main/markdown/public_contributions/maldives.md target=_blank>most public Maldivian contributions</a> on GitHub, with over 6000 commits. It is established as a trusted source of Dhivehi content, and delivers essential Islamic resources to the Maldivian community, such as:<ul style=list-style:none><li>✅ 40+ Articles on various Islamic topics, providing practical guidance for today’s Muslims.<li>✅ 11 Books of Hadith and Athar translated into Dhivehi (around 14,000 entries)<li>✅ 6 Quran Translations and Tafsirs, to help readers understand the Quran in their native language.<li>✅ 15 Books on Aqida and Usooluddeen, to strengthen faith and understanding of Islamic principles.<li>✅ 7 Dictionaries to aid learning and research (around 150,000 entries)<li>✅ Free access across Web, Android, and Windows platforms.</ul><h4>How your Support Makes a Difference</h4><p>So far, we have invested around 200,000 in developing Hadithmv, and most of it has been out-of-pocket. Your support will help ensure the project’s continued growth and sustainability. Every contribution, no matter the size, benefits yourself as well as the community. When people gain knowledge from this platform and act upon the Sunnah, you get to share in the reward for having facilitated it, in sha Allah. Your support helps us:<ul><li>Keep all content free and accessible for everyone.<li>Expand our library with more translations of Hadith, Quran, and Islamic texts.<li>Maintain high standards of accuracy and focus on authentic, reliable sources.<li>Develop and improve our digital platforms (Web, Android, Windows) and enhance features and user experience.<li>Enable our team of translators, developers, and scholars to focus on content development rather than fundraising.</ul><h3>Be Part of a Lasting Legacy</h3><p>The Hadithmv Project is more than just a platform – it’s a movement to bring the light of the Sunnah to every corner of the Maldives. With your help, we can continue to provide free, accessible, and authentic Islamic knowledge to everyone. Join us in this noble cause.
