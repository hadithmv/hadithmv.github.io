Give What You Wish</h3><h4>Help Spread the Sunnah - Your Contribution Makes a Difference</h4><p>The Hadithmv Project is a unique initiative dedicated to making the authentic teachings of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ and his righteous followers freely available in Dhivehi. We believe that knowledge should be accessible to everyone, without barriers. That’s why all our resources —Hadith collections, Quran translations, Tafsir, and Islamic books— are provided for free. By providing high-quality resources and material to everyone, we aim to empower individuals with knowledge and strengthen their connection to the Sunnah.<p>That’s why here at Hadithmv, we’ve adopted a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_what_you_want target=_blank>“Give What You Wish”</a> model. Instead of locking our content and features behind a paywall or asking for donations, we let you decide on how you want to contribute, based on what our services are worth to you. This approach feels more inclusive, empowering, and less transactional, without restricting the benefits for anyone, as we know first-hand the value of shared knowledge. It emphasizes the value of the project while giving our users the freedom to contribute in a way that feels meaningful to them.<h4>Why Contribute?</h4><p>The Hadithmv Project bridges language barriers and brings authentic Islamic knowledge to every Maldivian home.

Your support helps us preserve and share this knowledge for generations to come.</ul><h4>The Value We Provide</h4><p>Hadithmv delivers essential Islamic resources to the Maldivian community, such as:<ul style=list-style:none><li>✅ 10+ Books of Hadith and Athar translated into Dhivehi (over 8,000 entries)<li>✅ 6+ Quran Translations and Tafsirs, to help readers understand the Quran in their native language.<li>✅ 10+ Books on Aqida and Usooluddeen, to strengthen faith and understanding of Islamic principles.<li>✅ 5 Dictionaries to aid learning and research (over 100,000 entries)<li>✅ Free access across Web, Android, and Windows platforms.</ul><h4>How Your Support Makes a Difference</h4><p>Every contribution, no matter the size, will benefit both you and the community. When someone learns from our platform, you share in the reward of their knowledge, in Sha Allah. Your support helps us:<ul><li>Keep all content free and accessible for everyone.<li>Expand our library with more translations of Hadith, Quran, and Islamic texts.<li>Maintain high standards of accuracy and focus on authentic, reliable sources.<li>Develop and improve our digital platforms (Web, Android, Windows) and enhance features and user experience.<li>Enable our team of translators, developers, and scholars to focus on content development rather than fundraising.<li>Ensure sustainable growth of the project.</ul><h3>Be Part of a Lasting Legacy</h3><p>The Hadithmv Project is more than just a platform – it’s a movement to bring the light of the Sunnah to every corner of the Maldives.
