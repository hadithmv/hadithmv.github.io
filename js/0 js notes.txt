jquery.js (UGLIFY)	v4.0.0-beta.2+447432f
	https://releases.jquery.com/jquery
(note, in the beta v4, the difference of which is: 84.12-76.26=7.86kb
they removed all deprecated or under-supported dependencies, and while that file is smaller, keepConditions throws these errors:
$.unique() and $.isArray() is not a function, because they are depreciated in latest jQuery
solution is to update with Array.isArray() and $.uniqueSort()
	previously used 3.7.1, https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.7.1.min.js
	previously also used slim, it worked until i switched to loading json via ajax)
