jquery.js (UGLIFY)	3.7.1
	https://jquery.com/download/
	
(note, previously used the beta v4, the difference of which is: 84.12-76.26=7.86kb
https://releases.jquery.com/jquery
they removed all deprecated or under-supported dependencies, and while that file is smaller,
but it seems unsuitable for production, as gives weird errors regarding pagination which were not fixable at the time
also keepConditions throws these errors:
$.unique() and $.isArray() is not a function, because they are depreciated in latest jQuery
solution is to update with Array.isArray() and $.uniqueSort()
but that was fixed by updating the keepConditions jquery specific logic to vanilla
	previously also used slim, it worked until i switched to loading json via ajax, and vanilla js methods throw cors errors)
