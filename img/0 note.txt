SVGs:
update: netlify img optimizer seems to do it the best, currently did it on top of all of these

if background isn't transparent or doesn't have holes, might have to first center/remove background/get rid of empty area around using:
https://vectorpaint.yaks.co.nz/
fit to content

then
Vecta.io then combined with svgo, then followed by netlify seems to be the best svg compression method

https://vecta.io/nano
https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/
(this second one wont show svgs in indesign)



might have to manually then remove:
 stroke-width="0" style="background-color:#fff" viewBox="0 0 1080 1080"

that's compared to these when solo:

compresss.com
svgo (maybe better in node, havent checked except web version)
compressor.io
...
