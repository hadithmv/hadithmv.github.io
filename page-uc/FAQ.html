        <h3>The Dhivehi Platform for the Sunnah</h3>

        <p>
          Welcome to the official Hadithmv app. Your extensive digital Islamic
          library in Dhivehi. We offer a wide collection of texts, tools, and
          references in the Maldivian language.
        </p>

        <h2>📖 About Hadithmv</h2>

        <p>
          The Hadithmv project is a comprehensive, collaborative initiative
          dedicated to translating and disseminating the teachings of Prophet
          Muhammad ﷺ and the righteous Salaf in the Dhivehi language. We aim to
          make authentic Islamic knowledge accessible to all Maldivians and
          empower them to connect with traditional scholarship in their native
          tongue. Our mission bridges classical Islamic texts with modern
          technology to serve the unique needs of the Dhivehi-speaking
          community.
        </p>

        <h3>🔭 Our Vision</h3>
        <p>
          To create the most comprehensive, accurate, and accessible digital
          collection of Islamic texts in Dhivehi, empowering every Maldivian to
          connect with the Sunnah and the way of the Salaf regardless of their
          background, location, or resources.
        </p>

          I don’t know how to use Hadithmv / I can’t copy or search / I find
          this difficult and am stuck?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Reading the instructions first might help. Learn about them
          <a href="howToUse.html" target="_blank"> here</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Who founded Hadithmv?</h3>
        <p>
          Abu Yahya, Mohamed Ashraaf Ibrahim. Graduate of the Faculty of Hadith
          -Islamic University of Madina, and Web Developer.
        </p>

        <h3>Why was Hadithmv created?</h3>
        <p>
          We saw that the people of our time (between the 20th and 21st century)
          were far from the Sunnah, the Salaf (Righteous Predecessors), as well
          as holding onto them. These people, both the learned and unlearned in
          religion, would give precedence to their intellect above the Aathaar
          (Narrations). They would either misunderstand, distort these Aathaar
          to fit their views, or reject them in one way or another. There was
          also much spread of innovation in religious matters and it was made
          fair seeming to the masses. And those who knew no better took ignorant
          and misguided individuals as leaders and Imams. And so we created a
          digital resource for the people that could be a means of reminding
          them of the Sunnah and holding onto it, and what the Salaf of the
          Ummah and the scholars of Aathaar were upon. And to warn them of the
          innovations and desires of the deviant, so that they may refrain from
          them. And we ask Allah that He makes us firm upon Islam and the
          Sunnah, until we meet Him, without having changed or distorted
          anything from the religion, and that He makes us of those by whom the
          Sunnah is revived, and innovation is made to die off, and that He
          protects us from Fitnah, both from what is apparent from it as well as
          what is hidden. Ameen.

        <h3>
          I have a suggestion / correction / question. How can I contact you?
        </h3>
        <p>Simply reach out to us from the menu.</p>

        <h3>
          Is Hadithmv on social media / can you make a page and post Hadith?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Yes, we can be found on Facebook, Viber, Telegram, Instagram and
          Twitter, where we have been posting Hadith. Links can be found on the
          main page.
        </p>

        <h3>Why don’t you add a clickable Tasbih counter to Hisnul Muslim?</h3>
        <p>
          That would be an easy thing to do. Yet it is still better that you
          count it on your fingers instead.
        </p>

        <h3>
          How do I continue reading a book from the last place I was at a later
          time?
        </h3>
        <p>There are three ways to go about this.</p>
        <p>
          • Firstly, in both the online web version of Hadithmv, as well as the
          Android app, the current page will automatically stay in place even if
          you reopen it after closing the browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Secondly, for both the Web and offline apps, you can get the current
          place where you were reading by doing the following: on a book’s page,
          you can click the “copy current page link” at the bottom, this places
          it in your clipboard, which you can paste anywhere for safekeeping.
          Then when you need to go back to where you were reading, open
          Hadithmv’s homepage, at the top will be a box for that link. Paste the
          link there and press go or enter. You will then be taken there.
        </p>
        <p>
          • And thirdly, you can note down the page number of where you were and
          later input that number on the relevant page to continue from there.
        </p>

        <h3>Why am I getting a warning when downloading the Windows app?</h3>
        <p>
          The reason is that some browsers or antivirus software aren’t familiar
          with the program. So they might warn of a potential threat because it
          isn’t recognized. However it has been put through VirusTotal scans as
          you can see
          <a
            href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/url/0abe7addef3dd1e05de7cfd27c0bbfacaec0d2809f969f4dec262fb3e03100f3"
            >here</a
          >, and it checks out clean, so no need to worry about that.
        </p>

        <h3>Is there an iOS app?</h3>
        <p>
          Not yet. We don't currently have a developer specialized in apple
          products or familiar with the Swift programming language. The same
          goes for Flutter or React Native. Currently, iOS, macOS and Linux
          users will have to use the online version of Hadithmv in the browser.
          In sha Allah there will be an iOS app, contact us if you would know
          someone who could help with that.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I join the Hadithmv project?</h3>
        <p>
          If you do not know Arabic, or if you make Ta’weel of Islamic Texts,
          then no. Do not come anywhere near this. This has nothing to do with
          you, nor do you have anything to do with us. Do not even think about
          touching these texts, because the harm brought will be greater than
          the benefit. Otherwise, we could use help from Ahlu Sunnah who have
          skills in three key areas: translating, proof-reading and coding.
          Applicants should first and foremost have the correct creed and follow
          the way of Salaf. We used to be a lot more open when accepting
          helpers, but then we noticed Taw’eels in the translations stemming
          from the Aqidah of the writer, so we were obligated to put a stop to
          it, because this is the Deen we are talking about. After those
          prerequisites, we are looking for people that are optimistic,
          self-motivated, responsive, able to meet deadlines, and do not feel
          offended when corrected. We judge people’s work by their speed and
          completeness, and things like acquintanceship, popularity and
          certificates have little use if their wielders are lacking in the
          former aspects. Obviously, we cannot work with people who don’t
          respond when asked how the work is going, or whose translations are
          done whenever one feels like it. The problem with that is even if they
          do it later and then submit, we would have already had it done by
          someone else by then, making their submissions useless. Rather we
          follow a schedule, calculate our releases, and will not put a project
          on hold for anyone or anything. If there is too much delay on any one
          end, work will immediately be transferred to someone else, so as to
          not hold things up. That said, feel free to contact us if there are
          any queries. Or if you meet the requirements, then you can begin
          translating right away
          <a href="supportHadithmv.html">from here</a>. While we wish that
          everyone benefits from these works as a whole, we also ask that you
          give back to the community if you are able. Jazakumullah khairan.
        </p>

          regarding this matter in Dhivehi.
          -->

        <h3>Why translate?</h3>
        <p>
          There has always been a great lack of classical Islamic works being
          accessible to Maldivians, translated properly and free of distortion.
          Yet there hasn’t been enough of an effort made towards solving this
          issue. Although people talk about doing something about it, nowhere
          near enough has been done. So while the need has existed for as long
          as it has, and anyone suitable should definitely step up to fill the
          role, we decided that we were not going to wait around. And so we went
          ahead and got this project up and running, and Alhamdulillah, things
          have progressed a lot since then. And as of now, Hadithmv is a well
          established project. Unlike various other groups that have come and
          gone, we don’t keep ourselves and what we do in the dark or closed
          off, nor do we fail to respond when it comes to holding up our
          commitments. Our work is right there in the open for anyone to access.
          We don’t start working on something, do it halfway, and drop things
          from there. While some teams may have gotten ahold of one resource or
          another, like a PDF or so, we aimed at collecting all those materials
          and much more. We also utilize special tools and modernized resources
          for the job, which aren’t limited to being either just digital or
          physical, which is the real bottleneck that others face. This helps us
          get our content up and out there as efficiently as possible, and thus
          the team is able to continuously build upon a proven flow of work,
          instead of having to start out from scratch. We thank Allah for these
          tools and management, because without a comparable setup, it would
          have taken years to get anything done. May Allah reward all those who
          participated in this abundantly and perpetually. Any good that comes
          of this is from Allah, and any shortcomings are from ourselves and
          shaithan. O Allah, please accept and bless this work of ours, and make
          it from our good deeds. Let it be a Sadaqa Jariya (continuous charity)
          that remains until the Day of Judgement. And forgive the brothers and
          sisters who participated in it, guide them to the true path, and keep
          them firm upon it, along with their families and friends. Ameen.

             Can I work with Hadithmv but be nameless and anonymous?
            </h3>
            <p>
              While on the one hand that is easy enough to do, take a moment to
              understand the bigger picture here. Yes, we should be sincere and not
              seeking praise. And indeed it is all about the reward and not the credits. Now
              to answer this issue, first of all, because software development is
              involved, it is important that we document our work. Secondly, the way
              of the people of Hadith is to record everything, and noting down people
              and what they did is sort of their specialty. Thirdly, imagine if we
              were all nameless and anonymous, thinking it was he ideal way to go,
              then there would be no direction, no feedback, and no response. Say
              someone found a mistake somewhere, wanted to report it, but because we
              chose to hide ourselves, they ended up never being able to make it to us. And even
              if a few of us kept ourselves known while the rest were unreachable,
              people could get busy, contacts could change, and the known people could become
              inactive, while the unknown could then become the most active, which brings us back to the
              need to name names. Keeping a log is the responsible thing to do.
              Fourthly, one only needs to manage their heart and intentions, in order
              to be sincere and not praise-seeking, and if done properly, this should
              allow you to take credit for work rightfully done, it’s as simple as
              that. In the very least, allow us to list your Kunyah. And of course
              sisters can work with other sisters on these projects.

        <h3>How else can I help with Hadithmv?</h3>
        <p>
          One way is by rating the Android app. Note that you can rate without
          showing your name if you don’t write anything. Another way is by
          sharing Hadithmv with your friends. If you ever wanted to spread
          Islamic knowledge in Dhivehi, or maybe even thought about distributing
          a lot of books to Maldivians all around the world, then in this day
          and age sharing Hadithmv is as easy as it gets. Furthermore, the
          Prophet ﷺ said: “Whoever guides someone to goodness will have a reward
          like one who did it.” -Sahih Muslim 1893.

        <h3>Who else has participated in the Hadithmv project?</h3>
        <p>
          Hadithmv has had various helpers over time. Most of them are friends
          and colleagues from the Islamic University of Madinah, as well as
          brothers and sisters who studied in other colleges and faculties,
          along with other students of knowledge, individuals skilled in the
          Dhivehi and Arabic languages, and others who help with the code
          itself. Click

              Note that here at Hadithmv, we

        <h3>
          Why is it called Hadithmv, and why are there other than Hadith in it?
        </h3>
        <p>
          While Hadithmv initially started as a website providing the Dhivehi
          translation of a small collection of 40 Hadith, it has since developed
          into much more than that. While the primary focus will always be
          reviving the Sunnah and making it accessible for everyone, it became
          important to include everything that would help in achieving that
          goal. The most important of which would be the Quran, followed by
          books on the correct Aqida. Supporting language material regarding
          Arabic was also found to be indispensable. Other useful tools and
          content have also been made available for those who wish to benefit
          from them. At the same time, it won’t hurt non-technical people in the
          slightest by its presence, even if they don’t know how to use it.
        </p>

        <h3>Why is Hadithmv not all in Dhivehi, why is there English?</h3>
        <p>
          For quite simple reasons actually. As most developers and
          multi-lingual contributers will already know, the nature of technical
          and international collaboration, especially on GitHub, requires some
          amount of documentation to be in English.
        </p>

        <h3>
          What platforms, websites, apps, software and tools do you personally
          use?
        </h3>
        <p>
          We sometimes get asked this question, so we have compiled a list for
          that which you can see<a href="otherLinks.html" target="_blank">
            here</a
          >.
        </p>

        <h3>What exactly is the All Hadith and Athar section?</h3>
        <p>
          It is simply a very large collection of various Hadith and Athar,
          collected from our own works as well as different sources on the
          internet. Meaning it has our translations as well as that of others.
          Typically the content there is to be regarded as drafts, needing
          additional checking before use. But still it can be beneficial to have
          something to write upon and carry on from rather than having to start
          from scratch with nothing, for those who know how to use it that is,
          which is why the page is there in the first place. As for those people
          who go there, take a look and say, it’s full of mistakes, obviously
          have no idea how to use it at all. Also if you don’t see the total
          number of Hadith in that page increasing as months go by, it’s not
          because we aren’t working on anything, rather what we work on needs to
          be further revised before we place it out there publicly. And we
          haven’t stopped collecting translations from the internet either, we
          have them archived, but just haven’t had the time to sort them and
          find the corresponding Arabic text for them before uploading.
        </p>

        <h3>
          What is the difference between the ‘Hadithmv Quran Translation’, and
          ‘Bakurubey’s Quran Translation’ which is also on Hadithmv?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The Hadithmv translation is based on the official Dhivehi translation
          that is mainstream in the Maldives, but without the Ash’ari
          misinterpretations regarding Names and Attributes of Allah, which is
          something well-known about the current 2007 edition of the said book,
          as well as the earlier 1971 edition. The Arabic words that were in it
          have also been written in Dhivehi in our version, and other linguistic
          improvements have also been made. This has all been mentioned in
          Dhivehi on its relevant page. We were the first to change the Arabic
          words within that translation to proper Thaana. We were also the first
          to fix all of its Ash’ari Tauweels. And all praise is for Allah.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for Bakurubey’s translation, it is the work of Abu Bakr Ibrahim
          Ali, from Hinnavaru Island, who passed away on 20/1/2013. His
          translation has two parts, a (somewhat) word-to-word translation, and
          a general translation. We were the first to digitize that work, and
          the reason we chose to do so was because it didn’t have the Ash’ari
          Tauweels that the other translations suffered from, and also had a
          word-to-word segment, yet it was stuck in just PDF form without any
          hard copies or electronic text that the public could access, with no
          one to give it the proper availability it deserved.
        </p>

        <h3>
          There’s another separate ‘Bakurubeyge Tharujama’ app, was that made by
          you?
        </h3>
        <p>
          No, that was made by Ahmed Ahsam, a developer from Hulhudhuffaaru. He
          reached out expressing interest in making a Flutter application. The
          Lafzy and Ijmaly sections are reversed on that app.
        </p>

        <h3>What can I mainly do on Hadithmv?</h3>
        <p>
          Primarily you can read various Islamic translations of Quran, Hadith,
          Aqidah, Duas as well as other content. You can also use Hadithmv like
          a dictionary. You can find the source references for these books. You
          can look up texts in Dhivehi as well as Arabic, and can search even
          without Arabic diacritics. You can copy and paste the translations to
          and from any device, through any kind of media. You can select how
          many items to display on the screen at one time. You can jump to any
          page. You can use filter options to see only specific texts. You can
          show and hide different types of text. You can also use keyboard
          shortcuts on the desktop, etc. You can click

        <h3>Is it all just translations? What else is there on Hadithmv?</h3>
        <p>
          No, Hadithmv is not only translations. On the home page, there is a
          button that says Text Editor, and another that says Other, clicking on
          that will show other pages such as an Umrah/travel checklist,
          information about Madina, a Khutba template, information about
          Hadithmv, backup mirrors for the site, a list of contributors,
          instructions on how to use Hadithmv, a list of tools and libraries
          used to make it, privacy policy for the app, license for Hadithmv, and
          so on.
        </p>

        <h3>What is the fastest way to write ﷺ?</h3>
        <p>In the app or site, on the homepage, there is a button that says,</p>
        <p class="rtlText rightAlignedText">
          ނަބިއްޔާ ﷺ ޙަދީޘް ކުރެއްވިއެވެ: ”ހެޔޮކަމަކަށް މަގުދައްކައިފި މީހަކަށް،
          އެ ހެޔޮކަން ކުރި މީހަކާ އެއްފަދަ އަޖުރެއް ލިބޭނެއެވެ.“ [މުސްލިމު
          1893].
        </p>
        <p>
          Click the “ﷺ” from there and it will instantly be copied to your
          clipboard, and you can paste it wherever you like. Now this is just a
          copy and paste. However, on the Edit tab of the Text Editor, you can
          write ss- / -ސސ- / صص and it will automatically be turned into ﷺ.
        </p>

        <h3>What is the fastest way to add up a total / calculate my Zakat?</h3>
        <p>
          You can use the Text Editor. From there, click the Calc tab, and in
          the first text box, write whatever numbers you want added up. It will
          calculate the total amount, as well as the Zakat of that total.
        </p>

        <h3>What else can I do on the Text Editor?</h3>
        <p>
          The Edit tab shows various functions to manipulate text, and can click
          ‘Help is OFF’ to turn it on and then it will show what each button
          does when you hover over it. There are also some useful links
          regarding text processing that can be seen when you expand for more
          information at the bottom. The Copy tab has various buttons that
          instantly copies pre-set text to the clipboard. The Calc tab shows a
          sum calculator, a QR code generator, a calculator for the last third
          and half of the night, a link to calculate the day of a child’s
          Aqiqah, a unit converter, etc. The Diff tab compares two texts and
          visually shows the differences between them.
        </p>

        <h3>
          I messed up the search / settings on Hadithmv, how do I reset things?
        </h3>
        <p>
          If you are on the app, then simply closing the app fully and then
          opening it again will reset it. If you are on the web version then
          clear the search box, clear the selected options, set the number of
          items viewed to default, and deselect the extra fields you have chosen
          to show. Or you can just fully clear the cache from the browser and
          revisit to that page again by pressing (Ctrl + Shift + R).
        </p>

        <h3>Is Hadithmv free?</h3>
        <p>
          We are providing our content free of charge, and it will remain that
          way, in sha Allah. Because we know first-hand that knowledge does not
          decrease when shared and made accessible to all, rather it only
          increases. However, if you would like to support the project, then you
          are welcome to reach out to do so.
        </p>

        <h3>How is Hadithmv different?</h3>
        <p>
          It is the first program of its kind in the Dhivehi language, and as
          far as we are aware, the only. We designed our content to load fast
          and use a fraction of your data. In more ways than one, Hadithmv saves
          you time and money, because every byte counts. Furthermore, we like to
          keep things minimal yet modern. We don’t spend time creating flashy
          animations or searching for filler photographs to go with what we
          write. Nor do we bother with creating or using effeminate sounds and
          humming as background noise for Islamic lecture clips, which only take
          away focus from what is being said, and the only reason modern Daa’ees
          do such a thing is because they stumbled across some equally ignorant
          people doing it, and felt they had to fit in, and no other reason. We
          realized early on that a one size fits all approach and readily
          available templates do the job much more efficiently. This way we can
          focus on what is important, delivering quality content instead of
          worrying about trivial secondary matters. Nor do we limit ourselves to
          bulky hard-coded PDFs that are hard to read on mobile, and mostly
          impossible to search text in. Rather our content is responsive and
          easily searchable, with custom options like copying or choosing how
          many items to display. Furthermore, we don’t do things in waves that
          come and go, or get people worked up on something for short bursts
          that inevitably fade away. Instead, we aim for steady work and sure
          outcomes that are designed to last. And when it comes to social media,
          we keep things bite-sized so subscribers can follow along even on a
          busy schedule. These days, there is a lot less need to ferry people or
          books back and forth across the country, that ship has sailed long
          ago. And even PDFs are slowly starting to feel like dinosaurs. The
          generation of today expects whole electronic libraries to be
          responsive, fit in their pockets and be immediately usable. We hope to
          continue delivering on those expectations, in sha Allah.
        </p>

        <h3>Could you record video and audio to go with the Hadith?</h3>
        <p>
          Fundamentally, we work with making the source texts available for
          everyone, as everything else is built on that. Once that resource is
          readily out there, it becomes so much easier for others to create
          multimedia based on it. This is why we have chosen to invest most of
          our time and effort in this essential area, as it is more important in
          the long term than spending hours recording or editing other media. As
          the years go by, images get more pixelated and blurrier as they keep
          getting reuploaded and compressed. Videos become outdated as search
          algorithms push them further back as new ones replace them. As for
          audio, changes in scripts or mistakes require re-recording again, and
          it is very likely that Dhivehi text-to-speech engines will progress to
          a point where they will accurately read whole books for us, instead of
          us having to rely on people to keep recording and editing clips all
          the time just so they can be listened to. In brief, we concern
          ourselves with long term, long lasting goals instead of temporary,
          short term ones. Because the reality is that a lot of channels,
          groups, domains, blogs, posts, articles, and so on have all come and
          gone, leaving not a trace of what once was. But without a doubt, there
          is one thing that remains the same; the fundamental value of the core
          text, which will keep getting reused and built upon over time and time
          again, and so that is precisely where we have chosen to commit to.
        </p>

        <h3>How does Hadithmv make content at this pace?</h3>
        <p>
          It is mainly due to our modernized workflow and tools. Instead of
          tediously having to do everything manually, we tend to automate things
          as much as possible. This allows us to create a few months’ worth of
          content that otherwise would have taken others years to do by hand. We
          avoid doing things over and over again and suffice with scripts
          wherever possible, as we find manual repetition to be cumbersome and a
          waste of time. Inevitably, modern methods will always outstrip legacy
          ones when it comes to performance and delivery, no matter the numbers.
          Even though by the Grace of Allah we have writers such that some of
          them are worth 30 others. Furthermore, we use a lot of software to
          help with our work, some of which we have mentioned or made available
          for use on the site.
        </p>

        <h3>Where is Hadithmv based?</h3>
        <p>
          In the Maldives, although most of the initial code and content was
          written in Madinah.
        </p>

        <h3>Who is Hadithmv for?</h3>
        <p>
          Quite simply, everyone. From students to teachers, children to
          parents, and seekers of knowledge to scholars, etc.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Is Hadithmv affiliated with any party or organization, whether
          governmental or an NGO?
        </h3>
        <p>
          No, Hadithmv is not affiliated with any party or organization. It is
          an independent Maldivian project, unaffected by the influences of
          third parties whether local or international. And all praise is for
          Allah. The brand name "Hadithmv" is registered for the purpose of
          application development as well as translation services, but we do not
          have the partisan Wala and Bara that other groups do.
        </p>

        <h3>How is Hadithmv funded?</h3>
        <p>
          For the most part, the development and maintenance of the project has
          been paid out-of-pocket by the developer, praise be to Allah.
          Recently, we have also started accepting contributions from the
          public, and we are grateful for any support that comes our way. We are
          not an NGO, nor do we have any sponsors or partners. We are simply a
          group of individuals who are passionate about sharing Islamic
          knowledge and making it accessible to every Maldivian.
        </p>

        <h3>Are the translations correct?</h3>
        <!--
              <a
                style="cursor: pointer"
                onclick="window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight);"
                >bottom</a
              >
            -->
        <p>
          In sha Allah. We strive to make them as accurate and understandable as
          possible. But perfection is only for Allah, so if an inaccuracy is
          found somewhere, or even a better suggestion comes to mind, you can
          report it to us so that we may look into it as soon as possible. It
          should also be mentioned that there is no substitute for being able to
          read and understand the original Arabic. And even the best
          translations are not guaranteed to be absolutely free of possible
          human or technical error. Even if university-level people have
          translated texts, rechecked them several times, and had them reviewed
          and approved by the Ministry of Islamic Affairs for distribution, it
          does not mean those texts are now undoubtedly free of faults. And if
          we were to never include anything except only texts that were 100%
          perfect in every way, we would only have the Arabic Quran and nothing
          else. Yet we have tried to include that which would benefit the people
          as best we could, even though it is inevitable that there will be
          mistakes. Also we encourage you to learn the language as much as you
          can, in order to unlock for yourself deeper comprehension regarding
          the meanings of the classical texts. May Allah make it easier for you
          to study the Quran and Sunnah in their original language. Furthermore,
          it is important to note that not everything is to be translated
          literally, and the overall meaning must be preserved when conveying
          the texts. Unfortunately, we see some people trying on their own to
          piece together a translation word-for-word, and then end up failing to
          understand both the original text as well as the context. It must be
          pointed out that just a dictionary will never, ever be enough to
          translate Islamic texts such as these. One needs to have proper
          knowledge of related Islamic sciences such as Nahu, Fiqh, Usool,
          Mustalah, Ruwat, etc. and even then, they would have to refer to the
          explanations of the scholars if they wish to translate anything
          accurately. Otherwise one will just end up misleading oneself as well
          as others, may Allah save us.

        <h3>
          Do you have any advice for someone who would like to do their own
          translations?
        </h3>
        <p>Follow these rules when translating anything:</p>
        <p>
          • Have the correct Aqida, Manhaj and Usool first. Mistakes here are
          much worse than mistakes in grammar. And they will seep into your
          translations and lead others astray no matter how good your language
          is.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Know both languages well enough to translate. Both the language of
          the source as well as the end language. Machine translation and
          dictionaries won’t suffice.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Know the Islamic sciences related to the source material at hand. Be
          familiar with the terms, guidelines, principles, and so on. Talking
          outside your boundaries will only produce astonishing confusions.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Translate as close and accurately as possible to the source text.
          Minimize paraphrasing unless the clarity of the meaning is affected.
          At the same time don’t negate or misinterpret the reality of the
          source text.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Make clear what parts of the translation are actually in the source,
          and what parts you have added from outside. Use brackets, footnotes
          and so on. Otherwise, those who come after you could end up confused.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Be sincere, seek help from Allah, have integrity, be consistent,
          don’t be afraid to ask for help, and don’t give up.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Start small, easy and slow. Take simple but certain steps first,
          know what you can and can’t handle, and build upon your work and flow.
          Don’t habitually start up several projects and finish none of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Always keep reading and learning. It will improve your knowledge and
          translation skills, as well as help you correct and avoid mistakes.
          Continue and keep going.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Don’t just write something once and then forget about it. Go back to
          it once in a while, re-read and improve it. Don’t be too lazy to fix
          typos even when it’s pointed out by someone after a while.
        </p>

        <h3>Are the translations approved by the Islamic Ministry?</h3>
        <p>
          The translated books which have been approved by the Islamic Ministry
          will have an approval reference number on its page. While others may
          be still in the making or pending approval.
        </p>

        <h3>Are all the Hadith here authentic?</h3>
        <p>
          If a Hadith is from Bukhari or Muslim, then it is undoubtedly
          authentic. For any other book, the grading of a Hadith scholar is
          required before saying it is authentic. Some references on Hadithmv do
          include such gradings, while others do not have them yet.
        </p>

        <h3>How do you source your Arabic text?</h3>
        <p>
          We usually rely upon the texts of the Shamela library program, as well
          as others. We look for the best and most accessible source for the
          text, as that is what most people will find most easily available and
          can rely on, then we use the best references we can find even if it’s
          from a hardcover book. Also, while there might be several publishers
          and editors for a particular title, we try to use prints that the
          scholars recommend, because they have gone through the various books
          on the market, and selected only the very best available. Sometimes we
          end up changing the source text if a better one becomes available from
          another publisher. We have even done this up to three times for just
          one of our Hadith books, but Alhamdulillah, having scripts for the job
          saves a lot of time.
        </p>

        <h3>What numbering system do you use to reference Hadith?</h3>
        <p>
          We usually use the indexing scheme of Muhammad Fuad Abdul Baaqi when
          it comes to the main books of Hadith, as it is the most commonly used
          and easiest to look up. In any case, refer to the source book we used
          to know which numbering scheme is being used.
        </p>

        <h3>
          When I looked up the reference number from a source, why did it not
          match?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Different editions and prints may use different numbering schemes.
          Make sure that you looked up the same source books that we ourselves
          took the numberings from.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Is it okay if I don’t reference the source books and numbers of Hadith
          when including Hadith in writings of my own?
        </h3>
        <p>
          It's always better to reference. First of all, not doing so is
          considered unacademic. There are standards and protocols in place so
          that people can look up Hadith from their original sources with ease
          and cross reference the texts for themselves. Not doing so may be seen
          as a lack of credibility and signal the absence of care and diligence
          when it comes to handling these texts. Proper referencing is one way
          by which the liars can be told apart from the truthful, and the fake
          Hadith from the sound ones. Many a time fabricators try to avoid
          putting forth their sources yet still want others to think they are
          legit. Checking up on where it came from is one way to expose such
          schemes. We even see that the Orientalists and non-Muslims take care
          to mention the sources and indexes of the texts they criticize,
          because they know that without it what they write will not be taken
          seriously. Furthermore, some celebrity Dawah influencers have begun a
          trend of lazily adding the half-baked sentences such as “Source:
          -Prophetic Guidance”, “-the Prophet”, “-Hadith” or “-some website” on
          every post, or even worse, attributing the statements of the Salaf and
          scholars to themselves. This is low, even for unlearned Aammees who
          have not studied the religion, considering the wide-spread availabilty
          of knowledge resources nowadays. And lastly, you should also include
          the number of the Hadith, as opposed to writing just the name of the
          source book and omitting the number. Saying that there are multiple
          numbering schemes out there is a weak justification. Just use the most
          popular one and be done with it. Surely, you have taken your text from
          one of those sources, so include the number from where you found it,
          it’s as easy as that. No excuses. A simple, clean citation is all
          that’s needed. It’s not like you’re making a medium level Thakhrij,
          where you would include the name and number of the volume, as well as
          section, chapter, publisher name and print edition for every Hadith.
          And you’re certainly not making an extended level Thakhrij, where you
          make a full in-depth study detailing all the different chains of
          narration pertaining to a single Hadith, mentioning the differences
          and commonalities they have, bringing up the status of the narrators,
          and so on. In conclusion, if you can't be bothered to to make the most
          meager of citations to the most sacred of texts, then maybe it’s time
          to reconsider what service you can do for the Dawah.
        </p>

        <h3>What are Hadith?</h3>
        <p>
          They are the sayings, actions, approvals as well as the physical
          characteristics and manners of Muhammad ﷺ, the final Prophet sent by
          Allah. Hadith is also called Sunnah. After the Quran, Hadith is the
          second source of all Sharia legislations as well as behavioural
          etiquette standards in Islam. We can only know what we should and
          should not do through the Messenger ﷺ. Following the Messenger ﷺ is
          the only way to salvation and all that is good, and choosing any other
          path is falling into wretchedness and destruction, in this world as
          well as the next.
        </p>

        <h3>What is Takhrij?</h3>
        <p>
          Takhreej is referencing the Hadith text to the source book from which
          it is originally found.
        </p>

        <h3>Is there a dark mode / night theme?</h3>
        <p>
          The site automatically switches the theme based on your system
          preferences, however, the app does not as of yet.
        </p>

        <h3>What fonts does Hadithmv use?</h3>
        <p>
          We use KFGQPC Uthman Taha Naskh, as well as a private Dhivehi font
          developed by
          <a href="https://hassaanmv.com">Hassaan Abdul Razzaaq</a>.
        </p>
        <!--
            <p>On the site and app; primarily Mvtypewriter and Yakout, as well as KFGQPC Uthman Taha Naskh for Quran. As for the PDFs and hardcover books; KFGQPC Uthman Taha Naskh and a private Dhivehi font developed by Hassaan Abdul Razzaaq.</p>-->

        <h3>For the Arabic Quran text, do you use Rasm Uthmani or Imlaaee?</h3>
        <p>
          Both. By default Imlaee is shown, which is taken straight from
          Tanzil's Quran text. It can be switched to Uthmani using one of the
          buttons below the Ayat, or by toggling column visibility.
        </p>

        <h3>Why is the site different from the app?</h3>
        <p>
          The site gets updated first, so the latest changes will always be
          available there. We only roll updates to the app later, so that we can
          be sure that everything works smoothly on the site beforehand. This is
          why the site will always have a higher version than the app.
        </p>

        <h3>Why is a translation different from before?</h3>
        <p>
          We might have corrected it or found a better translation. Here at
          Hadithmv we do not believe in writing content once and then simply
          forgetting it. This is not just another book that doesn’t get updated,
          or an article that sees no changes. Rather it is possible to edit and
          update our texts on the site anytime. Think of it in terms of a
          ‘living standard’. We are always striving to improve and build upon
          the translations, which are too important to just write once and then
          abandon after.
        </p>

        <h3>Why is a book on Hadithmv incomplete?</h3>
        <p>
          Most likely because it is still in the process of being written and
          checked, it will be fully available once ready, in sha Allah.
        </p>

        <h3>Could I know more about a particular book?</h3>
        <p>
          Usually there is information about the book at the bottom of its
          respective page. Also there might be a link to another page regarding
          that book. Otherwise feel free to contact us for more information.
        </p>

        <h3>Which books are currently available?</h3>
        <p>
          You can find those on the main page. We might have some other books in
          the making, but are awaiting further checks before being shared
          publicly. The content we have drafted and kept in-waiting is actually
          more than the content we show on the site. Once internal checks have
          progressed to a point that we are satisfied, we then make them
          available for public release.
        </p>

        <h3>Which books will be available soon?</h3>
        <p>
          While we focus mainly on Hadith and the Sunnah, we also include
          content on Quran, Aqida, Duas, language and other topics whenever it
          is called for. So exactly what book we are working on will constantly
          be changing from one completed work after another, so consider joining
          the translation team to be in on the loop. Although we can definitely
          say this much; we have a great selection of classical works that we
          plan to translate in Sha Allah. May Allah grant us the Taufeeq in
          releasing those books. It has also come to our attention that a number
          of errand boys have been popping up in our dm’s for sole purpose of
          scooping out what we are working on or how far we’ve progressed, in
          order to relay that back to their masters as if it were the next piece
          of juicy gossip. Needless to say breath will not be wasted on such
          earmarked informers.
        </p>

        <h3>Why did you translate Muwatta instead of this and that book?</h3>
        <p>
          Three reasons. Firstly, because it is one of the Sihah books, like
          Sahih Bukhari and Muslim, and all the Marfu’ Hadith in it are Sahih.
          Secondly, it has a high Isnad, even higher than Sahihain. And lastly,
          because it has around 2000 or less Hadith, compared to the 7500 that
          Bukhari and Muslim each have. And we will be using the repeat Hadith
          from it in the Sahihain when the time comes. We also note that most of
          the people who question our translating of Muwatta, do not properly
          understand the value of this book and its lofty standing among all
          others. Had they understood, this would not have even been an issue in
          the first place.
        </p>

        <h3>When will you translate Bukhari and Muslim?</h3>
        <p>
          We already have a number of translations from the Sahihain, and we
          will soon begin to do them from start to finish in earnest. Do not
          worry, it is definitely one of our main targets, and we are on our way
          there in Sha Allah. May Allah grant us Taufeeq. Aameen.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Do these texts have explanations (Shurooh) or English translations?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Check the bottom of the page of a book for links to their Shurooh as
          well as other translations.
        </p>

        <h3>Are there any physical books I can get?</h3>
        <p>
          Our physical books are available from
          <a
            href="https://www.facebook.com/Message.of.Islam.mv/"
            target="_blank"
            >Message of Islam</a
          >.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Can you pin certain posts on certain social media, to make it easer to
          read from there?
        </h3>
        <p>
          We don’t think there’s a need to pin just any post. We don’t post a
          full Hadith book from start to finish without anything other than that
          in between. Depending on the occasion, we post content relating to
          Friday, Ashura, Eid, Ramadan, etc. These posts-in-between-posts could
          last a day, several days, or even a month. We even repost Hadith books
          sometimes. Not to mention that our translations have definitely
          changed since we first posted them. So making use of the site first,
          then the app, then pdfs is a better choice for reading Hadith books
          from start to finish, compared to only reading one-time translations
          on social media, which have definitely changed by now.
        </p>

        <h3>Does Hadithmv have any mirrors, in case the main site is down?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes, click
          <a href="404.html">here</a> to see them. They update in real-time,
          excluding the netlify mirror. Use this mirror in case you need to use
          an older version of Hadithmv for whatever reason. Which might be when
          a recent update breaks a function somewhere on the main site.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Will you continue to update and improve Hadithmv, both in content and
          design?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Yes, Hadithmv will continue to be improved and developed as long as
          Allah wills. We are releasing new versions, working on features,
          reviewing content and fixing bugs as we find them. Everyday there’s
          something to improve, and there are a lot more changes noted down
          waiting to be implemented when we have the time and resources.
        </p>

        <h3>What will happen to Hadithmv if something happens to you?</h3>
        <p>
          That has been discussed within the team, and we have protocols in
          place so that the project may continue with or without me. It has
          already been decided which people are to take over and direct the
          project, so there should be no worries about our work stopping, in sha
          Allah.
        </p>

        <h3>What is your belief, Aqeedah, Manhaj and Usool?</h3>
        <p>
          Our belief, creed, methodology and principles are those of Ahlul
          Hadith (the people of Hadith), and they are Ahlu Sunnah wal Jama’ah.
          We follow the Book of Allah and Sunnah of His Messenger, upon the
          understanding of the Companions, those who followed them in
          righteousness, as well as those who followed them in turn. Everything
          that the Salaf (the Pious Predecessors) agreed on and wrote as such in
          their books, we hold to be our belief. We take from where they took,
          and withhold from what they withheld. We believe in the Names and
          Attributes of Allah just as He and His Messenger ﷺ did, in a manner
          that befits His Majesty, without changing their wording, negating them
          as real, interpreting them as metaphorical, likening them to the
          creation, or asking how and why. We believe the meanings of His Names
          and Attributes are known to us, while their Kaif (manner) is unknown
          except only to Allah. And we affirm that Allah Rose (Istawa) over the
          heavens, is upon His ‘Arsh (Throne), with a Hadd (separate from His
          creation). He is not in every place, while His Knowledge is in every
          place. He is always close to His slaves with His Knowledge, and He
          draws closer to His righteous servants however He wills. He Descends
          to the lowest heaven during the last third of every night. He will
          arrive on the Day of Judgement. He has a Face, Eyes, Hands, Fingers,
          Shin and Feet. He Touches, Strikes, Holds, Grasps, Releases and Writes
          with His Hand. He showed Himself to the mountain in the time of Moosa
          and it crumbled. He Speaks, His Speech has sound and letters, and it
          can be heard by whomever He Wills. He Hears, Sees, Knows, Loves,
          Laughs, Dislikes, Hates, Plots, Mocks, Reprimands, Gives, Withholds,
          Moves, shows Mercy, becomes Shy, Pleased, Happy, Amazed, Angered and
          takes Retribution. He will place His Foot upon Hell. He created Adam
          with His Hands, in His Image and Breathed into him a soul belonging to
          Him. The Quran is His Speech, and not created. And He has created the
          actions of the creation. There is no one that can turn back His
          Decree, and we do not delve into and argue about the Decree, asking
          how or why. He has given mankind and Jinn free-will, and knows
          everything about them and all that will happen to them, even before
          their creation. To Him belongs the command as well as the creation. He
          is not questioned about what He does, but they, the creation, will be
          questioned. The Muslims will see Him on the Day of Judgement with
          their eyes, and He will Speak to each of them separately without any
          intermediary or barrier. He is free from all imperfections and
          shortcomings. Far removed is He from being like inanimate objects or
          idols that have no such attributes and do not speak or move, which is
          how the Jahmis describe Him. There is nothing like Him, while He is
          the All-Knowing, All-Wise. There is nothing bigger than Him. We
          believe in the Ghaib (Unseen), the Meethaaq (covenant Allah took from
          Adam and his descendants), the life of Barzakh (after death), the Hawd
          (lake) of the Prophet, and the Siraath (bridge) over Hell. That Jinn,
          magic, the Dajjal and the Beast, is real. And Easa is alive in the
          heavens and will descend in the End Times upon the religion of
          Muhammad ﷺ. We believe that Iman (faith) is belief with the heart,
          saying with the tongue and acting with the limbs. Iman increases with
          obedience to Allah, and has no upper limit, and it decreases with
          disobedience to Him, until it is all gone. And Iman does not count
          with anything less than the Shahada being spoken. It also does not
          count without disbelieving in everything that is worshipped instead of
          Allah or given rights that can only belong to Him. Iman also does not
          count unless action also accompanies it, while being able. And those
          who do not pray have left the fold. Whoever believes as the Salaf
          believed, and does not commit disbelief that takes them out of Islam,
          will enter Paradise by Allah’s Mercy. And whoever sins but does not
          commit disbelief as such, Allah may forgive them, or punish them in
          Hell for some time, before admitting them into heaven. As for those
          who do not believe, they will abide in Hell forever and ever. And
          Paradise and Hell are both created, and already exist, and will never
          end. And those who do not believe in the aforementioned are Jahmis,
          who negate the Attributes of Allah, said there is no God above the
          heavens, and claim there is nothing above the Throne. And the Salaf
          declared the Jahmis to be Mulhideen (atheists). Iman is sound and
          correct when we believe in all that we were commanded to believe in,
          and likewise disbelieve in all that we were commanded to disbelieve
          in. And disbelief is of two types, major and minor. Whoever commits
          major disbelief has voided his deeds and left the fold. And whoever
          commits minor disbelief is a sinner but does not leave Islam. We
          declare as being a believer or follower of the Sunnah, whomever the
          Salaf declared as being such. And we declare as being a innovator or
          disbeliever, whomever the Salaf declared as being such. And mocking
          the religion is a nullifier, whether done seriously or in jest.
          Friendship and association is for belief and its adherents. While
          animosity and disassociation is for disbelief and its adherents. And a
          Muslim may combine in him good deeds and bad. He is to be accompanied
          according to how much good he has. And he is to be avoided according
          to how much bad he has. And an innovator may combine in him more than
          one innovation. They are not to be accompanied, rather they are to be
          shunned, and they are worse than sinners. And it is not permissible
          for a Muslim to appoint a person that they are either loyal to or are
          hostile towards, except such a person who has been specified by Allah
          and His Messenger. Not everyone who falls into committing disbelief,
          becomes a disbeliever, until the conditions have been met and
          obstacles have been removed regarding that. And leaving the fold is
          not declared by mere suspicion, or unfounded doubt, or baseless
          unending chains, or in that which has not been proven as truly being
          such, or in that which the person has not been proven to have actually
          done it, or in that which there is an acceptable obstacle between the
          person and their leaving Islam, such as ignorance where they do not
          have a way to knowledge, or an acceptable misinterpretation that they
          have evidence for, or they make an unintended mistake like a slip of
          the tongue, or are coerced to do so against their will, or lose their
          mind and obligation to carry out their Islamic duties. And outward
          acts of disbelief do not occur from a person except due to it existing
          inwardly, even if it is claimed that we do not know whether their
          hearts and tongues concur, except for the case of one coerced. Saying
          otherwise is Irja. And we do not remove the people of the Qiblah from
          the fold of Islam. As for believing in Allah, His Messenger and His
          Book, then there is no excuse regarding that for mankind and Jinn in
          this world, whether the call of Islam reached them or not, apart from
          the mad person who was born from a Muslim, they are to be prayed upon.
          As for those whom the call of Islam does not reach, Allah will test
          them on the Day of Judgement, if they obey Him they will succeed, if
          not they will be punished, and even so these whom the call did not
          reach are not to be regarded as believers in name and rulings during
          the life of this world. And we do not declare any specific person to
          be in Paradise or in Hell, as long as there is not correct evidence
          that proves them to be specifically in either. As for other religions
          and sects, then in general they are declared to be either in Paradise,
          or in Hell. And as for the matter of the people of Riddah as well as
          the rest of the Mujrimoon, then they are to be dealt with by the ruler
          and his deputies with the law of Allah, as well as those who commit
          crimes that have fixed punishments in Islam. And the conditions
          regarding declaring someone to be out of the fold are narrower than
          those of declaring them to be an innovator. And those who fall into
          innovation due to ignorance are to be taught, yet they are still
          declared as innovators. The excuse of ignorance does not prevent
          someone from being labelled an innovator, even if it prevents them
          from being declared out of the fold. The establishment of Hujjah is
          not a condition in declaring someone to be an innovator. Indeed if
          they had knowledge, and still persisted upon their innovation, then
          that might have been a reason for them being declared to be out of the
          fold. And we do not declare the scholars to be innovators in matters
          of proper Ijtihad. We do not place those who came later as well as
          contemporaries to be the same level as the Salaf. And the Ijtihad
          (independent reasoning to arrive at an Islamic ruling) that counts is
          that which does not go against the Quran, Sunnah and the Salaf. And we
          are not to go out of the meanings and usages that were well known in
          the time of the Prophet, where there is no text to take it out of its
          origin, and so it is to remain in its origin. And there is no Qiyas
          (analogy) in matters of worship, creed, and methodology. And Naskh
          (abrogation) and Rajm (stoning) is true and correct. And every creed,
          methodology, movement and ruling created after the time of the Salaf
          to be made as part of the religion, is false and an innovation. And
          the basic principle when it comes to the legislation of the religion
          is that they are Tauqifi (made known to us from the Quran and Sunnah,
          and are not subject to rational thought). And the Haqq (correct way)
          is one and not multiple. And the only way that anyone who goes the
          Haqq is excused is if the Haqq is not known, or if he is a person who
          is truly worthy of Ijtihad and his Ijtihad counts as stated before, or
          is a someone who is allowed to do Taqleed (blind follow) someone else
          worthy of Ijtihad because the Haqq is not clear to him with evidence
          that he himself can understand. And the Haqq is to follow the Salaf in
          matters of Ijtihad first and foremost. And the obligatory is that
          which Allah and His Messenger commanded, and the forbidden is what
          they prohibited. And as the action of the Prophet which he did not
          command to follow, is recommended, except where evidence proves
          otherwise. And both Mutawatir (consecutive) and Ahad (isolated) Hadith
          are evidence that has to be accepted, even in matters of Aqida and
          Ahkam (creed and rulings). And whoever rejects that the Sunnah is
          evidence, is a Zindeeq (heretic), and his testimony is not to be
          accepted, his sacrificed animal is not to be eaten from, he cannot
          marry a Muslim woman, is not to be buried in the graveyard of the
          Muslims, and is not to be supplicated for with mercy. And spreading
          the Sunnah is a Fard Kifayah (obligation of sufficiency) upon the
          Muslims. And we view that the Ummah is sinning if it leaves out or
          conceals anything of the Book of Allah, or neglects taking care of and
          spreading it. And all of the Companions were just, and no ill is to be
          spoken of Muawiyah or ‘Aisha. And ‘Adalah (integrity) and Dabt
          (accuracy) of a narrator are conditions for accepting his narrations.
          As for the righteous scholar who makes a criticism of a person, then
          that takes precedence over another who makes praise of him, if the
          criticizer gives a clear reason, which is to be looked into. And we do
          not believe in participating in the street protests, so-called Islamic
          groups and organizations, political parties, and legislative bodies.
          And the obligation of the ruler is to establish the Sharia. And the
          obligation of the people is to obey and advise him, and not rebel
          against him for the sake of the Deen, as long as he is Muslim and
          establishing the religion in general, even oppression and wickedness
          occur from him. And if he commands something against the obedience of
          Allah, then he is not to be obeyed in that command, and he is still to
          be obeyed in other than that. As for the non-believer or one who
          changes the Sharia of Allah in general, then he is to be gone along
          with in that which does not go against the Sharia of Allah, and the
          public good for the Muslims is to be taken into account. And the
          matter of dealing with him or going out against him is left to the
          people of knowledge. And removing the ruler is not necessarily the
          same as rebelling against him. And it is upon the Muslim to stick to
          the Jama’ah (main body of Muslims). And prayer behind every good and
          wicked ruler is sound, as long as he does not commit a manifest
          nullifier. As for the public interest, the best way in respect to time
          and place is to take precedence. And if multiple evils or misguidances
          occur at the same time, and their followers fight each other over
          them, then the Muslim is not to support any of those groups over the
          other, rather he is to look at what is best for the Muslims, but if
          they are similar, or he has doubt, then he is to refrain and and leave
          all of that, because that is safest for his religion and himself. And
          preventing evil takes precedence over getting benefit, if they are
          both similar. And the interest of the Ummah and religion comes before
          the interest of the individual and what is personal. And taking
          Rukhsas (concessions) in the case of coercion and necessity is
          allowed. And those whom the people follow should avoid doing so. And
          we do not ask why and how about the religion of Allah. Neither do we
          say no to it. And we leave the knowledge of what we do not know to
          Allah. And the rulings and what Allah has informed us are not to be
          rejected using intellect and misinterpretation. And the blood, wealth,
          and honour of a Muslim is forbidden, except with the permission of
          Allah and a good proof. We view that sects and partisanship of all
          movements and causes that call to anything but holding fast to the one
          true Creed and Methodology to be separation and Fitnah. And there can
          be no agreement or coming together except upon a single Aqida and
          Manhaj; that of the Salaf. And if any of our sayings or actions go
          against what the they said and did, then it is our sayings and actions
          that are wrong, whether we know our mistake or not, or whether we were
          proven wrong during our life or after our death. We accept the Aathaar
          (Narrations) as they have reached us, and act upon them as the Salaf
          did. And we do that without imposing our own interpretation on them,
          or distorting them to fit our view, or coming up with ways to go
          around them. All of those are deceptions that the people of
          innovations and desires use in order to reject the Aathaar and find
          ways to escape acting on them. This is our Aqidah and Manhaj. And as
          such, we will not allow any other creeds or methodologies to show up
          in any of the content here. Another important reason why this project
          had to happen was because of the widespread Ash’ari misinterpretations
          that had plagued the available Islamic books in Maldives. Despite
          Aqida and Manhaj being a major issue, and the most important of them
          all, these problems had gone on for too long, without enough of an
          effort being made to cleanse them of the various inserted deviations
          they had. We didn’t even have correct full translations of the most
          basic books of Islam, which are the Quran and books of Hadith. Yet the
          Nasara had succeeded in translating the Bible to the Maldivian
          language, and they were even translating Nasrani films as well.
          Unfortunately, these major issues had persisted throughout generations
          of Maldivians, even with the presence of over 300 Islamic graduates.
          But in sha Allah, we aim to solve these problems. May Allah grant us
          Thaufeeq. Ameen.

            As for the one who is a disbeliever, or the one who changed the law of Allah in general, then he is to be gone along with in that which does not contradict the law of Allah, and achieves the public interest of the Muslims. As for the matter of dealing with him, revolting against him, or removing him from power, then that is to be referred to the scholars.

        <h3>How and when did you start Hadithmv?</h3>
        <p>
          Our first code commit reads ‘July 17, 2017’. It all started back when
          the founder, then 22, had finished the first 2 years at the institute
          of Arabic language (Mauhad), and had a study break before
          transitioning to Thanawi in Madina. Allah decreed that he would travel
          home and marry at that time, and his spouse happed to know something
          of HTML. Through her, he learned the basics of HTML, and continued
          with the rest by himself before returning to Madina. At the time he
          was writing code on a phone, as he had no laptop, and ended up making
          a basic page showing Nawawi’s 40 Hadith in Dhivehi. Later he met a
          Maldivian student from a different university who inspired him to
          translate the major books of Hadith together with him. To be frank, he
          was blown away by the idea. It was a huge endeavour, one that he
          though to be almost impossible. How could someone like him, not even
          an undergrad yet, who had written a meager 40 Hadith, take up the task
          of translating thousands and thousands of Hadith, which would have
          been required even if the work was split up between colleagues. But
          that person he met had convinced him of how important it was, and that
          it had to be done by someone, no matter what. And in that moment he
          saw the truth for what it was, made no more excuses, and had no more
          reservations. He believed every word his friend had said, even more
          than than the friend himself. He was sure of it, as sure as anyone
          could ever be. It took root in his heart, and he began thinking of how
          best to execute it. He came up with ideas of how it could be done
          easier and faster, leveraging technology and better resources instead
          of just a plain old PDF. However, when he later met the person who
          gave him the idea, it turned out they had given up on it on their end.
          They said they were too busy, and had asked others to take it up
          instead, who more or less hit the same dead end. This news was
          extremely disappointing. He had come to person who inspired him, still
          burning to work on those Hadith right from where their conversion left
          off, only to have been told the dream was over. Yet he could not let
          it go, the eagerness he had did not change at all, and the important
          of the task still remained fresh in his mind. So he decided to take it
          up himself, and began to work on it in earnest, and has never stopped
          since. He has never looked back, never regretted it, and to this day,
          has never let go of that inspiration, and kept at it day after day,
          book after book. And all praise is for Allah.

        <h3>Has the Hadithmv logo changed?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. Initially it was made with English letters. Later it was changed
          to something more Maldivian, the lettering of which was designed by
          Mohamed Mafaz Ahmed.
        </p>

        <h3>
          How about using more / fancier images / icons / animations /
          transitions / colors / themes?
        </h3>
        <p>
          We’d like to keep this text based application as fast and efficient as
          possible. That means keeping the overhead small, loading fewer assets
          and taking up less storage. In fact there’s only one external image in
          the whole of Hadithmv, the logo. Everything else we handle with with
          various unicode characters and url encoded svgs.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Can I use the texts of Hadithmv in my own app / How is Hadithmv
          licensed as a software?
        </h3>
        <p>
          You can read about that
          <a href="../LICENSE.txt">here</a>.

        <p>
          You can read about that
          <a href="thirdPartyTools.html">here</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Why not make separate apps for all of the books?</h3>
        <p>
          The key idea is to have everything accessible in one place. A
          centralized, unified approach is the most efficient in terms of size,
          speed and development. In short, we did things this way to avoid
          redundancy and bloat. Otherwise a hundred books would be a hundred
          apps on each separate platform, which would be difficult and
          inefficient to maintain individually. Imagine if the Shamela Islamic
          Library had a separate program or app for each of their books, with
          multiple database engines that needed updating. That would be a very
          cumbresone way to go about things. In reality, this question is more
          of an issue of end users not understanding how sofware works, then it
          is of why not do this this or that.
        </p>

        <h3>Why is it Hadithmv.github.io instead of Hadithmv.com?</h3>
        <p>
          Also related to this matter, is how some say that writing .github.io
          in the URL of the browser takes too long. In response, we would say,
          who types out full URLs in the browser in this day and age? One only
          needs to google a mere word of the site name and they will find
          themselves there in no time. Not to mention how modern browsers
          autocomplete the URL the moment you write a few letters. Nevertheless,
          while Hadithmv has always been built and hosted on github instead of a
          separate domain, we do own the domain Hadithmv.com. And that website
          name redirects back to this one here on github. We don’t do it the
          other way around because of the temporary nature of custom domains,
          which in reality only last as long as they are maintained and paid
          for. We have seen time and again, how many Islamic sites that were
          once filled with so much content, die off along with everything that
          was in them. This is a great loss and very sad state of affairs.
          People think whatever gets on the internet stays forever. This is
          false. Unfortunately, most site owners choose to be exclusive and
          closed-ended, not making their code and content viewable at the source
          level, nor making backups, and not sharing their writings accessibly.
          So after a few years, their work ceases to exist because of various
          factors, such as not paying for the costs needed to keep the site up,
          which of course becomes more expensive if one does not know their way
          around technical things, or people became too busy in their personal
          lives to continue with these projects, or the sites were no longer
          updated to fit with modern designs and user experiences as technology
          progressed, or disputes arose within the team and ended up with them
          breaking off from each other. Also sometimes the content creators are
          fully dependent on outside IT people who come and go just like that,
          or if they didn’t have a technical team, then they were limited to
          basic third party software and never went beyond clicking some basic
          buttons and writing regular text in boxes just like everyone else. On
          the other hand, sometimes technically inclined folks want to make an
          Islamic site or app, yet don’t have the acquired Islamic knowledge to
          do so and have to rely on those who do, but those in turn end up not
          having the time, effort or consistency required for such a task. The
          reverse does also happen, where people with the needed Islamic
          knowledge are not able to learn or adapt to changing technology, while
          the brothers in IT were too busy with commercial work to devote their
          time to building and maintaining an Islamic project. In short;
          conflicts, inabilities, dependencies, bottlenecks etc. are usually
          what stagnate and kill off such projects. Similar to the above
          mentioned situations is how some only release their work in the form
          of hardcopy books to be placed on shelves, or others make do with only
          a channel on limited social media, or just suffice withing uploading
          plain PDFs somewhere on the web, the link of which usually dies soon
          after, and don’t bother going any further than that. If only creators
          made their content available on the web as well as apps openly,
          accessible on all media and platforms, kept up to date with changing
          trends of development, and had proper mirrors and backups, then people
          might have still been able to continue benefitting or even building
          upon them, even if and when something were to happen to themselves or
          the site. As for us, after trusting in Allah, we have tried our level
          best to avoid ending up like the aforementioned, which is why we chose
          to be on github and won’t expire or need renewal the way other domains
          do. We have also prepared several site backups to keep the content
          alive in case anything goes down. Because knowledge is simply too
          precious to let vanish. We have also placed all our code out there in
          public, along with mirrors, so that those who come later can be able
          to continue to use it and improve upon it. And more and more people
          are becoming tech and coding literate day by day. We also release PDFs
          of our finished works on the internet, as well as print physical books
          to be made available in bookstores. This way, we hope to have covered
          all angles in the most comprehensive approach possible. And success is
          only from Allah. Also, while we have mentioned a few of the reasons
          why Islamic projects end up failing and what can be done to avoid
          them, there is something bigger that comes before all of that; the
          matter of not being united upon a single Aqida and Manhaj, and this
          decisively dooms a project no matter how big or favourable it looks.
          How can a Jahmi with the title of Sheikh who misinterprets and negates
          the Attributes of Allah, get together with a watered-down Muaa’sir
          (contemporary) who wants to re-invent and modernize Fiqh by grasping
          at the Khilaf when the Haqq is one, and a liberalized lecturer who
          takes part in teacher’s day and free-mixing using some Batil Ta’weel
          of Maslahah when they mean their own pockets, and the everyday Sharia
          and law grad who trims the beard, trails the edge of their pants,
          listens to music, watches series, is in a relationship, and is
          basically no different from a dropout or layman, and a cute apologist
          who insinuates that Ibn Ziyad crossed the Strait of Gibraltar and
          traveled thousands of miles just to let the people there know that
          there is no compulsion in religion, and a biased Haraki who blindly
          follows some group or party, shouts in the streets and inevitably
          quits and retires from the movement when they’ve wasted enough of
          their life, and a deluded ’Aqlani who gives precedence to logic over
          the text, and a heedless techie who develops Islamic apps while also
          working on software for music and tv shows, and deals in Riba and
          dubious transactions on the side, and a Muta’asib nationalist who
          takes more delight in their frivolous honorifics and worthless buried
          statues than they do over the books and creed of the Salaf, and a
          brainwashed secularist who thinks Islam belongs in the heart or mosque
          and does not think of it as a complete way of life, or frankyly any
          other blind deviant who follows anything other than the Salaf, even if
          all these people had all the resources and manpower in the world, how
          could they ever contribute anything for the Muslims, when they are
          unable to even help their own selves and their own deeds are
          constantly invalidated? What Thaufeeq do they expect, when they have
          shunned the truth and Angered the Rabb? What can a ragtag band hope to
          achieve, when they are but a murky cocktail of falsehood and
          innovation? What good is their certificates and salaries when they
          have the Iman of the Murjiah? What could all their worldy and
          technical knowledge do, when they have chosen what fades away over the
          everlasting? What do they have to do with the Religion of Allah and
          the Sunnah of His Messenger, when they have turned their backs on what
          was revealed from the Heavens? What Haqq can they give victory to,
          when they themsleves were upon nothing to begin with? What on Earth
          could they possibly do, except fabricate a sham of a Deen and pretend
          to follow it in name? How could they guide anyone, when they are
          themselves misguided? Wallahul Musta’aan.

        <h3>What’s the deal with Thikijehi Thaana (Dhivehi Diacritics)?</h3>
        <p>
          This is one of the more controversial questions we sometimes get.
          First of all, we aren’t trying to get rid of thikijehi thaana. That is
          impossible. End of story. You’ll always find them in our content, even
          if not as much as you were used to back in your day. Secondly, as this
          is a developing issue that progresses as it goes, we do take into
          account two things in regards to this matter, the usage in the Radheef
          as well as current practices in contemporary articles. We don’t want
          to end up like those old Islamic translations with shakespearean
          pronouns that no one uses anymore. At the same time, we won’t be like
          those extreme modernists who replace sheenu with shaviyani. There’s a
          balance somewhere out there, we just have to find it. And to do that,
          we need to be ready to revise and make changes if necessary.
        </p>

        <h3>
          I learned about a Hadith, can I issue Fatwa and solve Fiqh disputes?
        </h3>
        <p>
          No, that is only something the scholars can do, because the Sharia of
          Allah is not spoken of except with knowledge. While Hadithmv is
          intended to be a resource for various Islamic texts, a single read
          alone is not sufficient for laymen to have formed a comprehensive
          opinion on a matter. Many individuals who do not know even the most
          basic amount of Arabic think that just because they have the internet,
          they are as capable as any scholar. This is nothing but a complete and
          utter fallacy. You cannot come up with your own reasoning nor make up
          your own analogy when it comes to the religion. That is simply not how
          things work in Islam. Anything related to Aqidah, Fiqh or Fatwa should
          always be taken from the Salaf, and those who followed in their way.
          Otherwise, one will only go astray, while leading others astray as
          well.
        </p>

        <h3>What is the most important thing?</h3>
        <p>
          The most important thing is to have the right Aqidah and Manhaj.
          Because it is the base, the very foundation. Everything else comes
          after. And this does not change no matter the place or time. Correct
          Aqida is the end, the goal, that we are trying to reach, and
          everything else is just a means to it. The good end will never, ever
          justify bad means, just as good means cannot justify a bad end. All of
          that is falsehood and deception. As Imam Malik said, “The latter part
          of this Ummah will never be rectified except by that which rectified
          the earlier part.” Know that having a lot of books, narrations,
          knowledge, deeds and so on, doesn’t comparatively matter if one does
          not hold the correct belief, isn’t firmly grounded in understanding
          Islam the way it was revealed, and doesn’t know Allah and His
          Messenger or follow them the way the best three generations knew them
          and followed them. And ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab, may Allah have mercy on
          him, said, “There is no excuse for anyone going astray thinking that
          he is upon guidance. Nor for abandoning guidance thinking it to be
          misguidance, since the affairs have been made clear, the proof
          established, and the excuse cut off.” And that is because the Aathaar
          and the Salaf have conclusively decided over (and preserved) all the
          affairs of the religion. And it has been made clear to the people, so
          it is upon the people to (obey and) follow. So surrender to their way
          and beware of rejecting any Athar. Do not debate and argue about it.
          Only comply and submit. Do not throw about examples and reason your
          way out of it. Only accept and affirm. Do not misinterpret its meaning
          to avoid acting upon it. The meaning is clear and the way the Salaf
          understood and acted upon is clear. Do not try to fit it into your
          views and narrative. Rather you must fit yourself into it and discard
          of you what doesn’t. Do not try to find ways around it. It cannot be
          escaped and neither can you pretend to be ignorant or blind. Do not
          leave it for any opinion. Throw those opinions to the wall. If a
          pragmatist says to you “We prefer Maslaha and Maqasid over Aqida and
          Manhaj”, then say “You are a Haraki who justifies means over ends, and
          are no different to those materialist westerners and their
          secularization movements”. And if a partisian says to you “We
          cooperate with each other in what we agree on, and we excuse each
          other in what we differ in”, then say “You are a Hizbi who gathers
          upon everything except the truth, excuses everyone regardless of
          creed, and are no different to those compromising clerics who call for
          unification of religions”. If an intellectual says about the Salaf
          “they are Rijaal and we are Rijaal” (ie; they are just men like us),
          then say “they are the Rijaal, and you are a Dajjaal (great liar and
          deciever), and you are an Aqlani who is no different from the
          philosophers and Mutakallimoon”. And if a Mua’wwil (misinterpretor of
          the Attributes of Allah) says to you “I disbelieve in a Rabb that
          ascends and descends”, then say “I believe in a Rabb that does
          whatever He wills, and you are a Jahmi who is no different to those
          Mulhideen who say that there is no God in the Heavens, or that God has
          no attributes, while it is only that which does not exist that has no
          attributes”. Know that the spreading of something far and wide for
          generations does not mean Allah is pleased with it. Know that
          knowledge and Deen is not an abundance of books and narrations. Know
          that the Jama’ah is not whatever the masses are upon, rather the
          Jama’ah is that which is in accordance to the Haqq even if you are on
          your own. Know that Falsafa and Kalam (philosophy and give precedence
          to intellect over texts) begins and ends with no answers. Know that
          innovation can be worse than the disbelief of the idol-worshipers and
          the people of the Book. Know that ‘Ilmul Kalam can be worse that
          killing, sorcery and fornication. Do not delve into or argue with
          ‘Ilmul Kalam, stay far, far away from it. Beware of innovation and do
          not ever give precedence to your intellect over the texts. Rather they
          come above your logic whether you understand it or not. Know that
          there is no matter more severe and harmful than not following the
          Salaf, using Kalam in the religion, and neglecting the Attributes of
          Allah, it is even worse than the matter of not ruling by the law of
          Allah. It is worse than not ruling by the law of Allah. It is worse
          than not ruling by the law of Allah. If you don’t know this already
          then go back and read the books of the Salaf again and again until
          either Allah grants you Thaufeeq and you find your religion, or you
          become of those who are destroyed by turning away from it. Indeed the
          Harakiyya (those who give precedence to means over ends, and material
          gain over the Salaf) will always lose their Deen and themselves every
          time their movement falters, as they were not hanging on to anything
          strong from the start. So when their means fail, their Eman fails with
          it and they retire, because they never had correct Eman to begin with.
          Know that Ahlu Sunnah has no Imams except from Ashabul Hadith. And if
          they (the people of Hadith) are not Taifatul Mansurah (the victorious
          group), then no one else is. Take the texts as the Salaf took them,
          and stop where they stopped. Anything further than that is
          destruction. You will not be fooling anyone except yourself. And there
          is none worse than a person whom when the Aathaar is brought to him,
          he dislikes it, distorts it, and does not act upon it, all so he can
          reject it. There is no good whatsoever in such a person. And that is
          the case whether an unlearned person does it, or a Muslim with
          something of knowledge who looks practising on the outside. As for the
          former, at least everyone can tell his apparent state and not be
          deceived in religion. But as for the latter, the problem is that he
          looks the part outwardly, and so those who don’t know any better are
          fooled into thinking that he is one who gives Nusrah to the Sunnah.
          And it is only when he fails to act on the Aathaar, and gives
          precedence to his views, that his ignorance shows, his reality comes
          to light, and his averseness to the Aathaar becomes manifest. He is
          but a wolf in sheep’s clothing, an eager pretender who thinks he knows
          Aqida and can teach it to others, when he is only a ruined lifeless
          house with nothing worthy inside it. And that is why this imposter is
          the more dangerous of the two, so beware.

        <h3>
          What does the Ummah need most right now / Where should we concentrate
          our efforts / What is the essential solution for the Islamic community
          / What should the Muslims focus on / What has to be done first and
          foremost / What is the most pressing matter / Where should our
          priorities lie, What is it that we need to agree on before anything
          else, What must we unite and gather upon, etc.?
        </h3>
        <p>Same as above.</p>

        <h3>Any final advice?</h3>
        <p>
          “Indeed the Ummah needs individuals - steadfast individuals - more
          than it needs groups who are not among the people of steadfastness and
          who only falter during crises, and who are not among the people of
          firmness and strength during challenges. For this reason, the
          Messenger of Allah ﷺ remained steadfast and persevered alone, while
          entire peoples and groups faltered. This is due to the strength of
          what is in the heart of steadfastness, determination, and faith, which
          differs from others. This is why you find among people those who are
          in a misguided environment, yet Allah Jalla wa ‘Ala keeps them
          steadfast in an environment of disbelief and misguidance. Allah ‘Azza
          wa Jalla keeps them firm on the truth, and then people marvel at their
          steadfastness, faith, strength, and resilience in the face of
          challenges. On the other hand, a person observes people in Muslim
          countries and among righteous people, or in righteous families, who
          deviate from the path to the right and left. They then fluctuate
          between the doors of truth at times and falsehood at others, and they
          may even be in various stages and depths of falsehood. And what is
          this a sign of? It is a sign that the faith which a person has - the
          faith by which a person is steadfast - is what anchors them in the
          face of crises, challenges, trials, and tests that Allah ‘Azza wa
          Jalla places in a person’s path and confronts them, and this is
          inevitable.”

        ان الامه بحاجه الى افراد الى افراد
ثابتين اكثر من حاجتهم الى جماعات ليسوا
من اهل الثبات وانما ينتكسون عند الازمات
ولا يكونون من اهل الرسوخ والقوه عند عند
التحديات لهذا رسول الله صلى الله عليه
وسلم
يثبت وثبت عليه الصلاه والسلام وحيدا
وانتكس اقوام وهم جماعات وذلك لقوه ما في
القلب من رسوخ وعزيمه وايمان يختلف عن
غيره ولهذا يجد الانسان من الناس من هو في
بيئه ضاله يثبته الله جل وعلا في بيئه كفر
وضلال يثبته الله عز وجل على الحق ثم يعجب
الانسان من رسوخه وايمانه وقوته وصموده في
وجه التحديات
وينظر الانسان فيما يقابل ذلك اناس في
بلدان المسلمين وبين اناس صالحين او في
اسر صالحين يحيد بهم يحيد بهم الطريق عن
يمين وشمال ويكونون حينئذ يتقلبون في
ابواب في ابواب الحق تاره وفي الباطل تاره
وربما كانوا في تدرجات من الباطل وفي
دراكاته المتنوعه

وهذا امارة على ماذا؟ امارة على ان الايمان الذي به الانسان الذي يثبت به الانسان هو الذي يرسخه في وجه في وجه الازمات والتحديات والابتلاءات والاختبارات التي يجعلها الله عز وجل في طريق الانسان وتعترضه ولابد ولابد من ذلك.

الانسان يأمر غيره استعن بالله يعني انه سيقدم على عمل سيقدم على شيء او سيقدم على قول او سيقدم على فعل او غير ذلك يؤمر بالاستعانة بالله عز وجل والتوكل عليه اذا اقدم على على ذلك. لان الانسان في طريق يسير الى الى الله سبحانه وتعالى والطريق في ذلك هو الصراط المستقيم الذي امرنا الله عز وجل بسلوكه وعدم والذي ندعو الله جل وعلا كل يوم اهدنا الصراط المستقيم صراط الذين انعمت عليهم غير المغضوب عليهم ولا الضالين
