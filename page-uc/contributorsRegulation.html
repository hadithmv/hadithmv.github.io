          this").

          the bottom of a book, click "Copy Current Page Link" and paste it
          somewhere on your device. To resume reading, open the home page, and
          paste it in the "Paste Page Link Here" box at the top.
        </p>
        <p>
          • You can also input a number into the "Page Number" box to jump to a

        <p>

          at the top, or "Back to Main Page" at the bottom.
        </p>
        <p>
          • On some Android phones, the back button exits the app. If this
          happens, use the above methods.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>8. TROUBLESHOOTING:</h3>
        <p>
          • If something malfunctions on a book, open the Navbar menu, and
          refresh the page using "Soft Reload" or "Hard Reload" found at the
          bottom.
        </p>
        <p>• If that doesn't work, report it to us using the Contact page.</p>
