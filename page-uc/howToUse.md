# How to Use

---

Welcome to Hadithmv: The Maldivian Platform for Sunnah Translations

Hadithmv is available both online as a website and offline as an application for Android and Windows.

To make the most of Hadithmv and avoid getting stuck, it is recommended to go through these instructions first.

---

### NAVIGATION

- Click on the "Navbar" at the very top to access the Menu.

- Below that is "Paste Page Link Here" box. It is not a search box, more on that later.

---

### READING BOOKS

- From the home page, select a category (e.g., Hadith) and open a book (e.g., Muwatta Malik).

- Change pages using the "Page Buttons", or by swiping on mobile.

- Jump to specific pages using the "Page Number" box.

---

### READING CONTROLS

- "Show 1" adjusts the number of entries displayed per page. (note: doing so may cause other functions to not work as expected).

- "Filter" can be used to filter content (e.g., by Chapter or Heading).

- "Extra Columns" allows you to show/hide specific parts of the book (e.g., Arabic, Dhivehi, Footnotes, Heading).

---

### COPYING TEXT

- "Copy" lets you copy all visible text. (note: hidden text won't be copied).

- You can also select text with the cursor and then right click to copy.

- Double clicking text performs a specific action on Hadithmv, as stated below. As such, triple clicking to select a paragraph will not work.

---

### SEARCHING

- Use the "Search Box" to find specific text within the current book.

- Double-click a search result to view it in its original context. (note: this ends the search).

- Use double quotes when searching for exact matches (e.g., "like this").

- Results appear instantly. Change the page to go to the next set of results.

- You can choose how many results appear at once using "Show 1".

---

### CONTINUING WHERE YOU LAST READ

- When using either the online website or offline Android app: Your reading position is automatically saved.

- Another way to get the saved position and continue from there is: At the bottom of a book, click "Copy Current Page Link" and paste it somewhere on your device. To resume reading, open the home page, and paste it in the "Paste Page Link Here" box at the top.

- You can also input a number into the "Page Number" box to jump to a specific page.

---

### RETURN TO HOME PAGE

- On book pages with the Navbar, click the "Hadithmv Logo" at the top left.

- On other pages, there will be a hyperlinked text saying "Hadithmv" at the top, or "Back to Main Page" at the bottom.

- On some Android phones, the back button exits the app. If this happens, use the above methods.

---

### TROUBLESHOOTING

- If something malfunctions on a book, open the Navbar menu, and refresh the page using "Soft Reload" or "Hard Reload" found at the bottom.

- If that doesn't work, report it to us using the Contact page.
