## Reporting Typos and Bugs

‚Ä¢ Before reporting mistakes, check whether these errors are present on our online [website](https://hadithmv.github.io/books/index.html). If it looks okay here, then there‚Äôs nothing for us to fix. It is the responsibility of third-party app developers to update their data from Hadithmv.

‚Ä¢ Check whether the page with the error has a note or disclaimer regarding the presence of errors, such as being in draft status. These are usually found below the translations of the page.

‚Ä¢ Mention where you found the error. What page was it on, and where exactly on the page is the issue.

‚Ä¢ When you send typos, don‚Äôt just send screenshots. Copy the plain text as is and send that as well. This helps us locate and fix errors more quickly.

‚Ä¢ If there is a bug regarding functionality, clearly explain what happens, and the steps to reproduce it.
