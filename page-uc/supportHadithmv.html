        <h3>1. Donation</h3>

        <h4>Help Spread the Sunnah - Your Support Makes a Difference</h4>

        <p>
          The Hadithmv Project is a unique initiative dedicated to making the
          authentic teachings of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ and his righteous followers
          freely accessible to the Maldivian community in their native language,
          Dhivehi. By providing free, high-quality translations of Hadith,
          Quran, and Islamic texts, we aim to empower individuals with knowledge
          and strengthen their connection to the Sunnah. Your support can help
          us continue this vital work and expand our project to benefit people
          even more. By donating, you become part of this effort to preserve and
          share knowledge.
        </p>

        <h4>Why Support Hadithmv?</h4>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Accessibility for All: Hadithmv is committed to breaking barriers of
            language, wealth, and location. Your donation ensures that every
            Maldivian, regardless of their circumstances, can access authentic
            Islamic knowledge for free.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sadaqah Jariyah: By supporting Hadithmv, you contribute to a
            continuous act of charity. Every person who
            benefits from the resources we provide becomes a source of ongoing
            reward for you.
          </li>

          <li>
            Empowering the Ummah: Many of the challenges faced by our society
            stem from a lack of understanding of the Sunnah. Your donation helps
            us educate and inspire individuals, families, and communities to
            live by the teachings of Islam.
          </li>

          <li>
            Preserving Knowledge: Hadithmv is building a comprehensive database
            of Dhivehi translations of Hadith, Quran, and Islamic texts. Your
            contribution helps us preserve and share this knowledge for
            generations to come.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>How Your Donation Helps</h4>

        <p>
          Every contribution, no matter how small, becomes a Sadaqah Jariyah -
          an ongoing charity - that will continue to benefit both the donor and
          the community, and when someone learns from our platform, you get to
          share in the reward of their knowledge, in Sha Allah. Your
          contribution helps us to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Keep all content free and accessible for everyone.</li>
          <li>
            Expand our library with more translations of Hadith, Quranic
            tafsirs, and Islamic texts.
          </li>
          <li>
            Maintain high standards of accuracy and focus on authentic, reliable
            sources.
          </li>
          <li>
            Develop and improve our free platforms (Web, Android, Windows) and
            enhance features and user experience.
          </li>
          <li>
            Enable our team of translators, developers, and scholars to focus on
            content development rather than fundraising.
          </li>

                  <h3 >Note:</h3>
                  
          <p >
            Sisters should use this form as a one-way means to submit translations
            anonymously.
          </p>

          <p >
            • You may also send translations that you have and we don’t.
          </p>
          -->

        <h3>Instructions:</h3>

        <p>
          • Translate only if you know Arabic, and do not make Ta’weel of
          Islamic texts.
        </p>

        <p>
          • To translate <strong>anonymously</strong>, open the link above in
          incognito mode.
        </p>

        <!-- <p>
          • In the document; work on the Arabic texts provided. Write your
          translation just below the Arabic. Translate Arabic texts that have no
          Dhivehi translation written by others beneath them.
        </p>

        <p>
          • If all the Arabic texts in the document have been translated by
          others, then patiently wait until new texts are provided.
        </p>

        <p>
          • If you would like to edit a translation someone else has done, write
          your edit below that person’s translation.
        </p> -->

        <p>
          • You don’t have to write “Sahabi rivaa kurevvi, rasoolaa hadith
          kurevvi”, we will write those and make them consistent.
        </p>

        <p>
          • Likewise, you don’t have to translate the Takhrij. eg: “Rivaa
          kurevvee Bukhari”.
        </p>

        <p>
          • You can make use of the
          <a href="https://hadithmv.github.io/page/textEditor.html"></a>

          </a>
          to write faster and use shortcuts.
        </p>

        <p>
          • You can make use of
          <a href="https://sunnah.com">Sunnah.com </a> to check the
          English translation. Note that they have mistakes.
        </p>

            >Dorar.net
          </a>
          to check the Arabic explanation.
        </p>

        <p>
          • Try to write at least 1 hadith a week at minimum. If you are able,
          feel free to try more than that.
