        <p>There are a few ways to help with this project:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Give What You Wish</li>
          <li>Translate Texts</li>
          <li>Spread the word</li>
        </ul>

        <hr />

        <h3>1. Give What You Wish</h3>

        <h4>Help Spread the Sunnah - Your Contribution Makes a Difference</h4>

        <p>
          The Hadithmv Project is a unique initiative dedicated to making the
          authentic teachings of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ and his righteous followers
          freely available in Dhivehi. We believe that knowledge should be
          accessible to everyone, without barriers. That’s why all our resources
          —Hadith collections, Quran translations, Tafsir, and Islamic books—
          are provided for free. By providing high-quality resources and
          material to everyone, we aim to empower individuals with knowledge and
          strengthen their connection to the Sunnah.
        </p>

        <p>
          That’s why here at Hadithmv, we’ve adopted a
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_what_you_want"
            target="_blank"
            >“Give What You Wish”</a
          >
          model. Instead of locking our content and features behind a paywall or
          asking for donations, we let you decide on how you want to contribute,
          based on what our services are worth to you. This approach feels more
          inclusive, empowering, and less transactional, without restricting the
          benefits for anyone, as we know first-hand the value of shared
          knowledge. It emphasizes the value of the project while giving our
          users the freedom to contribute in a way that feels meaningful to
          them.
        </p>

        <h4>Why Contribute?</h4>

        <p>
          The Hadithmv Project bridges language barriers and brings authentic

                  <h3 >Note:</h3>
                  
          <p >
            Sisters should use this form as a one-way means to submit translations
            anonymously.
          </p>

          </p>
          -->

        <h3>Instructions:</h3>

        <p>
          • Translate only if you know Arabic, and do not make Ta’weel of
          Islamic texts.
        </p>

        <p>
          • To translate <strong>anonymously</strong>, open the link above in
          incognito mode.
        </p>

        <!-- <p>
          • In the document; work on the Arabic texts provided. Write your
          translation just below the Arabic. Translate Arabic texts that have no
          Dhivehi translation written by others beneath them.
        </p>

        <p>
          • If all the Arabic texts in the document have been translated by
          others, then patiently wait until new texts are provided.
        </p>

        <p>
          • If you would like to edit a translation someone else has done, write
          your edit below that person’s translation.
        </p> -->

        <p>
          • You don’t have to write “Sahabi rivaa kurevvi, rasoolaa hadith
          kurevvi”, we will write those and make them consistent.
        </p>

        <p>
          • Likewise, you don’t have to translate the Takhrij. eg: “Rivaa
          kurevvee Bukhari”.
        </p>

        <p>
          • You can make use of the
          <a href="https://hadithmv.github.io/page/textEditor.html">
            Hadithmv Text Editor
          </a>
          to write faster and use shortcuts.
        </p>

        <p>
          • You can make use of
          <a href="https://sunnah.com">Sunnah.com </a> to check the English
          translation. Note that they have mistakes.

          <a href="https://www.dorar.net/hadith">Dorar.net </a>
          to check the Arabic explanation.
        </p>

        <p>
          • Try to write at least 1 hadith a week at minimum. If you are able,
          feel free to try more than that.
