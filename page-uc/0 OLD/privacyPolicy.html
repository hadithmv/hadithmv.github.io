          Privacy Policy For Application "Hadithmv"
        </h2>
        <hr /> -->

        <h3>
          <b>Last updated: 6/9/2024</b>
        </h3>
        <p>
          This privacy policy governs the use of the software “Hadithmv” (later
          referred as the “Application”) operated by Mohamed Ashraaf Ibrahim
          (later referred as the “Developer”).
        </p>
        <p>
          The Application is an Android and Windows application intended to make
          the sayings and teachings of Muhammad ﷺ as accessible and
          understandable as possible for the Muslim Maldivian community. Once
          this work is complete, they will have a hadith collection in their
          native Dhivehi language, in sha Allah. We are also working on making
          other Islamic works available, as well as beneficial tools and content
          for those who wish to make use of them.
        </p>

        <h3>What information does the software obtain and how is it used?</h3>

        <h3>
          <b>User Provided Information</b>
        </h3>
        <p>
          The Application does not require any user registration. The
          Application does not require the user to provide any personal
          information.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only User Provided Data that this Application uses is the text you
          provide directly within the Application when using search or editing
          text.
        </p>
        <p>
          All search or editing text is only stored locally on the device,
          within the Application private folder, following good security
          practices.
        </p>

        <h3>
          <b>Automatically Collected Information</b>
        </h3>
        <p>The Application does not collect any information automatically.</p>
        <p>
          The Application does not share any information automatically with
          third parties.
        </p>

        <h3>
          <b
            >Does the Application collect precise real time location information
            of the device?</b
          >
        </h3>
        <p>
          The Application does not collect precise information about the
          location of your mobile device.
        </p>

        <h3>
          <b>
            Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by
            the Application?</b
          >
        </h3>
        <p>
          Not applicable since the Application does not collect any information
          automatically.
        </p>

        <h3>
          <b>What are my opt-out rights?</b>
        </h3>
        <p>
          You can easily delete all User Provided Data by uninstalling the
          Application from the device. You may use the standard removal
          processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the
          application marketplace or network.
        </p>

        <h3>
          <b> Data Retention Policy, Managing Your Information</b>
        </h3>
        <p>
          This Application does not automatically collect, share nor retain any
          information. All search or editing text is only stored locally on the
          device, within the Application private folder, following good security
          practices.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you would like to update specific User Provided Data, you may do it
          directly within the Application, by editing or removing the text in
          question.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you would like to delete User Provided Data, you may do it by
          clearing the application’s data or by uninstalling the Application
          from the device. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may
          be available as part of the device or via the application marketplace
          or network.
        </p>

        <h3>
          <b>Children</b>
        </h3>
        <p>
          The Application does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not
          knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone
          under the age of 13. We do not use the Application to knowingly
          solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13.
        </p>

        <h3>
          <b>Security</b>
        </h3>
        <p>
          We are concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your
          information stored locally on the device.
        </p>
        <p>
          Be aware that, although we endeavor to provide reasonable security for
          information we process and maintain, no security system can prevent
          all potential security breaches (e.g., a zero-day attack targeting the
          Operating System – OS).
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to ensure an optimal security, you shall regularly install
          any update of the Application available from the application
          marketplace.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also advise you to regularly check for any OS update(s) that could
          be available and to enable automatic updates.
        </p>

        <h3>
          <b>Changes</b>
        </h3>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason.
          We will notify any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new
          Privacy Policy on this page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Be aware that, although we endeavor to provide reasonable security for

        </p>
        <p>
          You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any
          changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes. Changes
          to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this
          page.
