## Help Fund the Project

<!-- TOC --><a name="join-us-in-spreading-the-sunnah"></a>

### Join Us in Spreading the Sunnah

The Hadithmv Project is a unique initiative dedicated to making the authentic teachings of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ and his righteous followers freely available in Dhivehi. We believe that knowledge should be accessible to everyone, without barriers. That’s why all our resources —Hadith collections, Quran translations, Tafsir, and Islamic books— are provided for free. By providing high-quality resources and material to everyone, we aim to empower individuals with knowledge and strengthen their connection to the Sunnah.

<!-- TOC --><a name="your-contribution-makes-a-difference"></a>

### Your Contribution Makes a Difference

Here at Hadithmv, we’ve adopted a [“Give What You Wish”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_what_you_want) model. Instead of locking our content and features behind a paywall or asking for donations, we let you decide on how you want to contribute, based on what our services are worth to you. This approach feels more inclusive, empowering, and less transactional, without restricting the benefits for anyone, as we know first-hand the value of shared knowledge. It emphasizes the value of the project while giving our users the freedom to contribute in a way that feels meaningful to them.

<!-- TOC --><a name="why-contribute"></a>

### Why Contribute

- Knowledge for Everyone – We keep all content free so that no one is excluded from learning.
- Educating the Ummah - Helping individuals, families and communities better understand and implement the Sunnah.
- Sadaqah Jariyah – Every time someone benefits from this platform, your contribution continues to bring you rewards, in sha Allah.

## Translate if You Know Arabic

If you would like to help with translating Arabic texts, you can contact us from [here](contact.html).

<!-- TOC --><a name="instructions-for-translating"></a>

### Instructions for Translating

• Translate only if you know Arabic, and do not make Ta’weel of Islamic texts.

• If you do not want to be known, you can translate anonymously by opening this [link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1V3-5h4TK0-S-ZrpN3ocSPQLVN50Rfxn8gweP4puYY6A) in incognito mode.

• In the document; work on the Arabic texts provided. Write your translation just below the Arabic. Translate Arabic texts that have no Dhivehi translation written by others beneath them.

• If all the Arabic texts in the document have been translated by others, then patiently wait until new texts are provided.

• If you would like to edit a translation someone else has done, write your edit below that person’s translation.

• You don’t have to write “Sahabi rivaa kurevvi, rasoolaa hadith kurevvi”, we will write those and make them consistent.

• Likewise, you don’t have to translate the Takhrij. eg: “Rivaa kurevvee Bukhari”.

• You can make use of the [Hadithmv Text Editor](https://hadithmv.github.io/page/textEditor.html) to write faster and use shortcuts.

• You can make use of [Sunnah.com](https://sunnah.com) to check the English translation. Note that they have mistakes.

• You can make use of [Dorar.net](https://www.dorar.net/hadith) to check the Arabic explanation.

• Try to write at least 1 Hadith a week at minimum. If you are able, feel free to try more than that.
